<p>After a couple of weeks of hard work, with lots of assistance from <a
href="http://www.spastically.com/" title="Marshall Roch's Blog">Marshall
Roch</a>, I'm just about ready to launch the new Bricolage Website. Thanks to
hardware and hosting provided by <a href="http://www.netstumbler.com/"
title="NetStumbler.com Website">NetStumbler.com</a>, we now have a fully
functioning Bricolage installation and Web server for the bricolage.cc domain.</p>

<p>The new site will launch just before my OSCON talk on Wednesday. In
addition to having the great Web standards-compliant layout (thanks Marshall!)
and a decent amount of extra content, the templates for the site will be made
available for download, too. The templates will make a great <q>best
practices</q> example, both for bricoleurs and Bricolage evaluators. I think
they nicely show off the flexibility of the Bricolage CMS platform.</p>

<p>So do you want to see the beta? I'm making it available only to my fellow
Bricolage developers and to you, the readers of my blog. Just point your
browser at <a href="http://www.bricolage.cc/" title="The Bricolage
Website">www.bricolage.cc</a>, and then just <code>s/www/beta/</code> to see
the new site. I'm not providing a direct link to it here because it's going to
go away on Wednesday and I don't want to get any 404s. Feel free to send me
feedback on the new site--anything about it: design, layout, XHTML, CSS, etc.</p>
