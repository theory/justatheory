<p>chromatic's <a href="http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2009/04/the-why-of-perl-roles.html" title="Modern Perl Books: “The Why of Perl Roles”">post on Perl Roles</a>
reminded me that I've wanted for some time to blog about another kind of
composition. I call it “fuck typing.” It's kind of
like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing" title="Wikipedia: “Duck Typing”">duck typing</a>, only not really. I would
explain, but I think that my good friend, Mr. Vinnie Goombatz, will do a much
better job. Although if you're squeamish or easily offended, you might want to
skip it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How you doin'? Theory aksed me to talk about fuck typing. It'd be my
  fuckin' pleasure.</p>

  <p>You know how sometimes you're hacking (I <em>love</em> that word,
  “hacking”) some piece-a shit code, and you're using some cacasenno's
  module, but it doesn't quite do what you fuckin' want it to do?</p>

  <p>Here's what you say, you say, “Oh, you don't fuckin' <em>want</em> to
  gimme a fuckin' <code>prosciutto</code> method? You got a fuckin' problem?
  'Cause you're about to <em>have</em> a fuckin' problem, know what I'm
  sayin'?”</p>

  <p>I tellya what ya gonna do. You gonna fuckin' open up that fuckin'
  paisano's module, right there, just fuckin' cut it right open, and then you
  gonna fuckin' shove the a <code>prosciutto</code> method right into the
  module's fuckin' guts. “How do you like <em>them</em> apples, you fuckin'
  piece of shit?”</p>

  <p>And that's what you do. You fuckin' show him who's boss, know what I'm
  sayin'? If you don't get the fuckin' interface you need, you fuck the module
  up until you get it. Ain't no big fuckin' deal. Nice doin' biznizz wit'chou.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What's surprising to me is how accepted this sort of bad behavior is in
some <a href="http://www.juixe.com/techknow/index.php/2007/01/17/reopening-ruby-classes-2/" title="Reopening Ruby Classes">communities</a>. Oh, well, there are all kinds,
I guess.</p>
