<p>Much to my amusement, <a href="https://twitter.com/theory/" title="Follow me on Twitter!">Twitter</a> seems to think that I've tweeted over 5,000 times. I don’t see how this can possibly be, but there are days when I tweet a lot I guess. Still, 5,000 in a little under three years seems excessive. I realize that it counts DMs and retweets in that number (not many retweets yet, of course), but still, I question their algorithm. Since one can’t access one’s entire history of tweets (yet?), I can’t count for myself, either, alas.</p>

<p>In other news, I’ve been slowly making may way through my photos from the family <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/theory/collections/72157622739532091/" title="Photos from Tokyo and Kyoto">trip to Japan</a>. Yesterday, I posted photos from <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/theory/sets/72157622853441435/">Kiyomizu-dera, Gion, and Teramachi</a>, taken our first day in Kyoto. What a fabulously beautiful place! We walked around for hours, and it was a photographic feast. It was all I could do to trim things down to just 63 photos. I have many hundreds more to process still, from Kyoto, Nara, and Tokyo. I'll get them up over the next week.</p>

<p>As for my current status? I realize I've been blogging less, but I've been no less busy hacking Perl and PostgreSQL stuff. In addition to ushering out a new version of <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Pod-Simple" title="Pod::Simple on CPAN">Pod::Simple</a>, I've been updating <a href="http://github.com/theory/pod-site" title="Pod::Site on GitHub">the code</a> for my Perl doc browser project (<a href="http://www.bricolagecms.org/docs/current/api" title="Bricolage Documentation Browser">example</a>), adding features to <a href="http://pgtap.projects.postgresql.org/">pgTAP</a>, and, erm, planning other stuff. Things will likely be slowish through the holidays, but there should be some interesting stuff trickling out over the coming weeks. Till then, this status post will have to do.</p>
