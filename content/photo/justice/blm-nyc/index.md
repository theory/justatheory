I took advantage of the new City Bike dock in front of our flat to ride 80
blocks south through Central Park today to see the new [#BlackLivesMatter mural]
outside Trump Tower. Not too many people around, perhaps a dozen taking photos
and selfies. I joined them, then took a photo for a couple and their toddler in
front of the mural. I couldn't stop grinning under my mask. The mural may be
symbolic, but *holy cats* do symbols matter.

More photos [on Instagram].

Also, what a great ride this was. Thinking about quitting my job just to wander
around New York and take it all in. Love this city.
