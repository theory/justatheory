Three months into the Covid-19 Pandemic, I had barely left the apartment. But
summer humidity splashed int our little apartment --- and it became clear that
outdoor spread is almost nonexistent --- I started taking daily walks. I quickly
expanded my range, delighted to find that one can walk from the south end of
Central Park at 59th Street to the northern­most tip of Manhattan almost
entirely in parks. It's really quite stunning, and there's so much to take in:
architecture, views, rivers, flowers and trees, wildlife --- the works. Those of
you who follow [my IG] know.

On my jaunt through [St. Nicholas Park] yesterday, a branch shook vigorously
ahead, alerting me to an unusual presence. As I approached, this keen stare
greeted me, a mere 5-8m.

I don't know what I expected to see, but it wasn't *this!* I've heard that
red-tailed hawks[^maybe-red-tailed] live in the trees or buildings of the nearby
[City College of New York], but I never saw one I could recognize, and certainly
not this close. Turns out, red-tailed hawks are quite common [residents of New
York City], committed to pest control and delighting residents and visitors
alike. Myself included.

This one, however, paid little attention to me. Rather, it seemed quite curious
about this black [squirrel] running up a tree between us, about a meter away.

The squirrel kept running a loop up and down the tree. It would disappear from sight
(mine, not the hawk's), then reappear further down the trunk and scamper up again.
The hawk seemed curious, amused, then, perhaps, bored.

Eventually I put my phone away and continued my walk, but kept thinking about
this vignette. What story could one tell? Was the squirrel trying to protect its
home by distracting the hawk? Was the hawk already well-sated, and now committed
to satisfying its intellectual curiosity with a little [naturalistic
observation]? Maybe the hawk and the squirrel were friends and neighbors,
happy to enjoy a bit of camaraderie on a beautiful fall day in The City.

When I circled back an hour or so later, the hawk had moved across the path, and
now was poking around in the shrubbery. It saw me watching. Some ethno­graphy,
perhaps?

Naw, it kept picking something up and shaking its head; a dragonfly or cricket I
think, but couldn't get close enough to tell. Could be it was hungry after all.

Either way, it made my day. Man I love this city.

  [^maybe-red-tailed]: At least I *think* this is a red-tailed hawk. Though I
  see many bird watchers on my city schlepps, I myself am not one. Please do
  give me a holler if you happen to know just how mistaken I am.
