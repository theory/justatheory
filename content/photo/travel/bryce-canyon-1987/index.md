Back in 1987, my mom and I went on a trip around the American Southwest. I was
18, freshly graduated from high school. We had reservations to ride donkeys down
into the [Grand Canyon], but, sadly I got a flu and kept us in the hotel along
the rim.

The highlight of the trip turned out to be [Bryce Canyon], where I made this
photo of its famous [hoodoos]. Likely shot with Kodachrome 64, my go-to for
sunny summer shots at the time, on a [Pentax ME Super] SLR with, as I recall, a
28-105mm lens. Mom asked me yesterday if I'd scanned photos from that trip and,
digging into my scans, the deeply saturated colors with those lovely evergreens
took my breath away.
