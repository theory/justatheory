Yours truly, in a [2018 review] of [*Genius*], by James Gleick:

> Because our ways of understanding the universe are not the universe itself.
> They're explanatory tools we develop, use, and sometimes discard in favor of
> newer, more effective tools. They're imperfect, products of their times and
> cultures. But sometimes, in the face of an intractable problem, a maverick
> mind, cognizant of this reality, will take the radical step of discarding some
> part of the prevailing doctrine in an attempt to simplify the problem, or just
> to see what might happen. Feynman was such a mind, as Gleick shows again and
> again.

In case you're wondering why I'm linking to my own blog, while this piece dates
from 2018, I posted it only a few weeks ago. Originally I posted it on
Goodreads, but when [Goodreads unceremoniously deleted my account] I thought it
was gone for good. But two months later, Goodreads [sent me my content]. I was
back in business! With my data recovered and added to my [StoryGraph
profile][sg], I also took the opportunity to post the one review I had put some
effort into on my own site. So here were are.

In other words, I'm more likely to post book reviews on Just a Theory from here
on, but meanwhile, I'd be happy to be your friend [on StoryGraph][sg].
