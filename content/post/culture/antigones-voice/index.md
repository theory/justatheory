A couple months back, I saw *[Antigone in Ferguson]* at [St. Ann's Church] in
Brooklyn. This moving project pairs dramatic readings of [Sophocles’ *Antigone*]
with a stunning original choral arrangement performed by a diverse cast of
activists, students, police officers, and Ferguson and NYC community members. I
don't tend to go for the religious symbolism of Christian gospel, but these
stunning voices shot through me like a revelation. I think I understand a bit
what it means to be touched by God: the powerful, vulnerable expression of the
human voice --- a profound manifestation of the human capacity for creativity
and beauty --- broke my heart and raised my optimism for humanity. Don't miss it
if you get the chance.

The relationship between Antigone and King Creon also struck me in a new way, no
doubt because recent encounters with autocratic and sexist behaviors have been
front-of-mind lately.

Creon appears as a relatively thoughtful king, and doting uncle to Antigone and
her sister, Ismene. He forbade the burying of Polynices while still in the heat
of the just-ended war, and, despite his advisors' best arguments, stubbornly
rejects revoking the law. His inability to admit mistake despite the clarity of
its folly exemplifies classic authoritarian behavior: never admit error.
Naturally it leads to his downfall.

While Creon's advisors push for revocation of the law, his niece, Antigone,
refuses to submit to it, and further refuses to compromise her integrity or the
tone of her voice when speaking against it. She deliberately flaunts the law by
burying her brother, makes makes no attempt to deny it, and publicly excoriates
Creon at her trial. His intransigence will be his downfall, she proclaims. The
girl doesn't sugar-coat it, and in her passion, her voice rings out loud and
true to all assembled.

But, to Creon's ear, shrilly.

Stung by Antigone's passionate defiance, Creon finds her tone reason enough to
ignore the substance of her argument, to dismiss the risks she highlights. The
entire community rallies to her cry, but Creon, choked by his bruised ego,
commits to the logical extreme of his law and sentences Antigone to death. It is
his undoing, and a tragedy for Thebes.

One can learn a lot from Creon's missteps.

How often do we discount a woman's message because of her tone? When passion
speaks truth to power, what reasons do we find to dismiss it? When someone
cares, but poor leadership prevents understanding and growth, does the anger,
the passion, the righteousness sting the ego or motivate action?

I believe it important to recognize passion as a virtue, and tone as a
reflection of commitment. People who care about their world --- their work,
their environment, their society --- may be angered when it fails them. If it
stings when they tell you that you've made mistakes, that you're failing them
and other people, put ego aside, recognize that your implicit biases might
seek reason to dismiss them, and instead, *simply listen.*

My fellow white dudes, don't be like Creon. Recognize your fallibility, head off
your urge to disregard the message in the name of your discomfort, and beware
the ego's reflexive labeling of the messenger as a "whiner" or "negative nelly"
or even "not focused on problem-solving". This, too, tells you something.
Because the people who don't care say nothing. Those with the passion to speak
and the willingness to do so expect more of you, and want you to take the
opportunity to be better, and to make things better.

So maybe let's take a stab at meeting their expectations.
