Lets talk about that well-worn bit of wisdom: "assume positive intent." On the
surface it's excellent advice: practice empathy by mindfully assuming that
people may create issues despite their best intentions. You've heard the
parables, from Steven Covey's [paradigm shift on the subway][covey-subway] to
David Foster Wallace's [latent condemnation][dfw-kenyon] of gas-guzzling traffic
and soul-sucking supermarkets. Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi has [popularized the
notion] to ubiquity in corporate America.

In practice, the assumption of positive intent enables some pretty serious
anti-patterns.

First, focusing on *intent* downplays *impact.* Good intentions don't change the
outcomes of one's actions: we still must deal with whatever broke. At best, good
intentions enable openness to feedback and growth, but do not erase those
mistakes.

Which leads us to a more fundamental dilemma. In a [piece for Medium] last year,
[Ruth Terry], quoting the [Kirwan Institute]'s Lena Tenney, summarizes it aptly:

> By downplaying actual impact, assuming positive intent can deprioritize the
> experience of already marginalized people.

This remarginalization of the vulnerable seriously undermines the convictions
behind "assume positive intent," not to mention the culture at large. But the
impact transcends racial contexts: it appears wherever people present
uncomfortable issues to people in a dominant position.

Take the workplace. A brave employee publicly calls out a problematic behavior
or practice, often highlighting implicit bias or, at the very least, patterns
that contradict the professed values of the organization. Management nods and
says, "I'm glad you brought that up, but it's important for us all to assume
positive intent in our interactions with our co-workers." Then they explain the
context for the actions, or, more likely, list potential mitigating details ---
without the diligence of investigation or even consequences. Assume positive
intent, guess at or manufacture explanations, but little more.

This response minimizes the report's impact to management while simultaneously
de-emphasizing the experience of the worker who voiced it. Such brave folks,
speaking just a little truth to power, may start to doubt themselves or what
they've seen. The manager has successfully [gaslighted] the worker.

Leaders: please don't do this. The phrase is not "Assume positive intent for me,
but not for thee." Extend the assumption only to the people reporting
uncomfortable issues. There's a damn good chance they came to you only by the
assumption of positive intent: if your coworkers thought you had ill-intent,
they would not speak at all.

If you feel inclined to *defend* behavior or patterns based on presumption of
good intent, avoid that reflex, too. Good intent may be key to transgressors
accepting difficult feedback, but hold them accountable and don't let
assumptions stand on their own. Impact matters, and so must consequences.

Most importantly, **Never use the assumption of good intent to downplay or
dismiss the crucial but uncomfortable or inconvenient feedback brave souls bring
to you.**

Assume positive intent in yourself, never assert it in others, and know that,
regardless of intent, problems still must be addressed without making excuses or
devaluing or dismissing the people who have suffered them.
