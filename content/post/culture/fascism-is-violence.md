Aleksandar Hemon, [writing for *Literary Hub*]:

*The New Yorker* Festival [bills itself] as "Conversations on culture and
politics," but the important thing to understand about fascism --- and its
cohorts nationalism and white supremacism --- is that it's not a conversation.
It's not a set of ideas. No. *Fascism is violence.* One does not dialog with
fascism. Fascism is a violent terror to be stopped.
