[Kottke's right], this [interview with Jia Tolentino][interview] in *Interview*
is soo great. In a few cogent, direct, clear paragraphs, she covers her views on
quarantine, Covid, reading, pregnancy, capitalism, Black Lives Matter, policy
changes, protest, climate change, and more. An example, on white discomfort:

> I’m also suspicious of the way that Not Being Racist is a project that people
> seem to be approaching like boot camp. To deepen your understanding of race,
> of this country, should make you feel like the world is opening up, like
> you’re dissolving into the immensity of history and the present rather than
> being more uncomfortably visible to yourself. Reading more Black writers isn’t
> like taking medicine. People ought to seek out the genuine pleasure of
> decentering themselves, and read fiction and history alongside these popular
> anti-racist manuals, and not feel like they need to calibrate their precise
> degree of guilt and goodness all the time.

The [whole thing][interview]'s a gem, don't miss it.
