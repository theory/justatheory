A simple post. “Something to make you think,” Dustin Curtis wrote. I followed
[the link] and have hardly stopped thinking about it since.

Sam Harris wants to help non-religious people understand how it feels to be a
believer confronted with scientific rationality. Toward that end, he offers *the
fireplace delusion.* The idea is simple:

> On a cold night, most people consider a well-tended fire to be one of the more
> wholesome pleasures that humanity has produced. A fire, burning safely within
> the confines of a fireplace or a woodstove, is a visible and tangible source
> of comfort to us.

That love is misguided, however. The scientific evidence is compelling:

> The unhappy truth about burning wood has been scientifically established to a
> moral certainty: That nice, cozy fire in your fireplace is bad for you. It is
> bad for your children. It is bad for your neighbors and their children.

So far so good. People like to romanticize fires, yet [research shows] it to be
anything but wholesome. It's incontrovertible, and Harris presents the argument
well. I've never felt that fires were particularly healthy, so it was no
challenge to convince me.

Yet it seems that my reaction may be unique, to judge by the reactions of the
people with whom Harris has discussed the issue:

> I have discovered that when I make this case, even to highly intelligent and
> health-conscious men and women, a psychological truth quickly becomes as
> visible as a pair of clenched fists: They do not want to believe any of it.
> Most people I meet want to live in a world in which wood smoke is harmless.
> Indeed, they seem committed to living in such a world, regardless of the
> facts.

My reaction to such a commitment: *Those people are being completely
irrational.* Why would anyone argue with such compelling evidence, unless they
are so wed to their belief that it deafens them to the truth. They plug their
ears and over and over shout "I can't hear you!" These are Harris's friends:

> Of course, if you are anything like my friends, you will refuse to believe
> this. And that should give you some sense of what we are up against whenever
> we confront religion.

Now, I am not a religious person, and like Harris strongly advocate for the use
of scientific reasoning and rational thought in social, political, and economic
discourse. I have no bona-fides to offer, but personally find the entire idea of
religion to be nonsensical.

But even I think that this analogy --- admittedly imperfect, Harris says --- to
be entirely disingenuous.

The problem is not that religious people are irrational in their beliefs, but my
reading of *The Fireplace Delusion* makes exactly that point: Religious people
continue to believe in the face of rational refutation simply because they want
to believe. But that's a dishonest reading of faith.

*Faith has nothing whatsoever to do with rationality.*

Nothing. Nada. Faith is not an irrational resistance to rational reasoning and
facts, because it is not subject to rational reasoning and facts. It's something
different, an entirely other animal. Not irrational, but a-rational.

A better analogy than *the fireplace delusion* might be something derived from
it. I offer, instead, *love.*

Love is not rational. It cannot be refuted by rationality and facts. Scientific
reasoning may suggest that my entire biological purpose is to
[pass my genes on to my children]. Yet my deep and abiding love for [my wife]
does not enter into it. It might be argued that love evolved to increase the
chances of human genetic success, but such argument neither supports nor refutes
my love the way scientific research refutes the value of fire. It simply *is.*

It's not just love and religion that work like this, that are a-rational. Art.
Jazz. Hacking. That which motivates, that drives passion, dedication, and
creation, that embodies *culture* in the [Anthropological sense]-including, yes,
the pursuit of scientific research and reasoning-is a-rational. No, better: it's
*extra-rational.* That's part of what makes it beautiful.

You cannot refute love. You cannot refute art. You cannot refute faith. Because
they are not in the domain of refutation, are not subject to the facts. They are
something else entirely. Often-not always, but often --- they create *beauty.*

And beauty isn't subject to refutation, either.
