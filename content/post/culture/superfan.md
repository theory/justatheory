Terrific [talk] by Sacha Judd:

> Trust and psychological safety are core elements of high performing teams.
>
> Trust is the willingness of a party to be vulnerable someone else. Trust
> implies that you respect your teammates abilities and you respect their
> intentions. Psychological safety builds on trust and is more about how you
> feel about the team dynamics. What are the risks of blame if you try something
> and fail. 
>
> Trust is about individuals and psychological safety is about the team. And
> when we build teams that have that trust, where people feel like they can be
> their whole selves, and they feel safe enough to raise their hand, to offer
> contradicting opinions, to think differently and work differently and
> contribute in their own way. That’s when we get a high-performing team.
