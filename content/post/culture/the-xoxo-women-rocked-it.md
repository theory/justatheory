[XOXO] was fantastic again this year. Since it wrapped up a week ago, there have
been a number of fantastic posts from the likes of [Frank Chimero],
[Maciej Ceglowski], and [Kelly Kend]; you should go read them. I was
particularly moved by the unabashed vulnerability and honesty of the speakers,
and their willingness to recruit the audience to confront the debilitating
effects of [impostor syndrome]. I expect to write more about the festival in the
future. Or maybe I'll just create something awesome in the coming year, instead.

One thing struck me after the first day of talks that I've not noticed addressed
elsewhere. While women were under-represented in the audience (though far better
than at most tech conferences), but they were pretty well-represented among the
speakers. And the women speakers — oh man. *They. Kicked. Ass.*

[Erika Moen] openly shared her quest for sexual identity via comics. [Vi Hart]
hilariously described how to make money on YouTube — and [Andy] told her she
could keep going for as long as she wanted. [Molly Crabapple] raised important
yet seldom discussed issues around the independence of artists and the
availability of capital on the internet. [Julie Uhrman] humbly shared all the
ways in which [Ouya] has failed, and in doing so making it better. And
[Christina Xu] discussed [BreadPig]'s objective to enable artists to make a
living online without exploitation.

These amazing people weren't at XOXO because they're women; they weren't there
to represent women as a separate entity, or to talk about the
under-representation of women in tech. No, they were there because they've
created incredible things and wanted to share. Their energy was palpable. They
just came out on stage and totally fucking *rocked it.*

This is how it ought be. You make something. You're excited about it. Your
energy infects the audience. And your gender and ethnicity have nothing to do
with it. It's moving simply to be amazing.

Alas, XOXO is the outlier here. But it points to the future, and I'm excited to
help push it forward.
