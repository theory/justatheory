Self-professed language nerd Amy Devitt says [They is Smart]:

> Mixing singular and plural is pretty common in most people’s speech and even writing:
>
> *“The analysis of all the results from five experiments support that claim.”*
>
> And one common expression mixing singular and plural even sounds a lot like
> “They is” (and is often pronounced that way):
>
> *“There’s two kinds of people in this world.”<br/>
> “There’s lots of reasons we shouldn’t go to that party.”*
>
> So maybe it won’t sound so weird after all:
>
> *“Sam volunteers at the homeless shelter. They’s someone I really admire.”*
>
> Some varieties of English already match plural “they” with a singular verb:
>
> *“they wasn’t satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself”* (Kanye West line
> in *[New Slaves]*)<br />
> *“They is treatin’ us good.”* (Dave Chappelle [Terrorists on the Plane]
> routine)<br />
> *"They wasn't ready."* (Bri [BGC17] commenting on Oxygen Bad Girls Club
> experience)
>
> So why not singular “they” with a singular verb?
>
> *“They wasn’t going to the party alone.”*
>
> Using singular verbs when we’re using “they” to refer to one person might not
> be so weird after all.
>
> We have the same issue in some ways with singular “you.” Standard English
> varieties tend to use a plural verb even with singular “you.” So *“you are a
> fine person,”* not *“you is a fine person.”*
>
> Except lots of varieties and lots of speakers do use “you is.”

I've been thinking about this piece a lot since I read it a couple weeks ago. It
wasn't that long ago that I [surrendered] to using "they" as a gender-neutral
singular pronoun; today I'm embarrassed that my grammarian elitism kept me from
denying it for so long. No more of that! If anyone asks me to use singular verbs
with singular "they", I'll happily do it --- and correct my habitual mouth when
it fails me. For they who wants to be referred to using singular verbs, I will
use singular verbs.

Intellectually, I find this whole idea fascinating, mostly because it never
occurred to me, feels unnatural in my stupid mouth, but seems so obvious given
the examples. Some dialects have used this form since forever; the internal
logic is perfect, and only cultural elitism and inertia have repressed it. They
wasn't satisfied indeed.

But logic is a flexible thing, given varying semantics. In an addendum to the
piece, Amy writes:

So just as "they" can be used as a singular pronoun, plural conjugations become
singular when used with singular "they" if we just say they are. Everybody's
right! So make a habit of using the most appropriate forms for your audience.
