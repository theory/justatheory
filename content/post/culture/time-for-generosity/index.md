This video, [Timelapse of the Future], has kept me thinking ever since [Kottke
posted it] a few weeks ago. Given current knowledge, the expectation is that the
universe will go on forever, but thanks to entropy and expansion, it will
eventually be full of, well, nothing at all. This rather limits the time
hospitable to life. This arresting quotation from [Brian Cox] starting at the
12:55 mark captures it:

> As a fraction of the lifespan of the universe, as measured from its beginning
> to the evaporation of the last black hole, life, as we know it, is only
> possible for one thousandth of a billion billon billonth, billion billon
> billonth, billion billon billonth of a percent.

That's:

    .000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001%

Boy howdy our time is limited. We should make the best of it, to let our brief
time be as pleasant, happy, and fulfilling as possible. All of us. Be kind,
empathetic, compassionate, and generous with your fellow human beings. In the end,
only how well we treat each other matters.
