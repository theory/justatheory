Some database folks might be gasping for air, but not those of us steeped in
relational theory. In *[Database in Depth]*, relational theorist [C.J. Date]
poses a question:

{{% figure
  src   = "database-in-depth.jpg"
  class = "right"
  width = "300"
  alt   = `"Database in Depth," by C.J. Date`
%}}

The whole book is worth a read, especially the first four chapters, as it
does an excellent job of dispelling the myth that complex data types are
verboten in a properly normalized relational model. Another gem:

This is exactly why PostgreSQL offers [array], [XML], and [JSON] data types:
because sometimes, they are exactly what you need to properly model your
system.

So you go, Brent, you're doing it exactly right.
