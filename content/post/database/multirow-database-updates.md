Or you could just use one statement. Here's how to do it with a [CTE] on
PostgreSQL 9.2 and higher:

``` postgres
WITH up(name, salary) AS ( VALUES
     ('Jane',  1200),
     ('Frank', 1100),
     ('Susan', 1175),
     ('John',  1150)
)
UPDATE staff
   SET salary = up.salary
  FROM up
 WHERE staff.name = up.name;
```

Still on PostgreSQL 9.1 or lower? Use a subselect in the `FROM` clause
instead:

``` postgres
UPDATE staff
   SET salary = up.salary
   FROM (VALUES
       ('Jane',  1200),
       ('Frank', 1100),
       ('Susan', 1175),
       ('John',  1150)
   ) AS up(name, salary)
 WHERE staff.name = up.name;
```

Stuck with MySQL or Oracle? Use a `UNION` query in a second table:

``` postgres
UPDATE staff, (
         SELECT 'Jane' AS name, 1200 AS salary
   UNION SELECT 'Frank',        1100
   UNION SELECT 'Susan',        1175
   UNION SELECT 'John',         1150
) AS up
   SET staff.salary = up.salary
 WHERE staff.name = up.name;
```

Using SQLite? Might make sense to use a temporary table for thousands or
millions of rows. But for just a few, use a `CASE` expression:

``` postgres
UPDATE staff
   SET salary = CASE name
       WHEN 'Jane'  THEN 1200
       WHEN 'Frank' THEN 1100
       WHEN 'Susan' THEN 1175
       WHEN 'John'  THEN 1150
   END
 WHERE name in ('Jane', 'Frank', 'Susan', 'John');
```

If you need to support multiple database architectures, sure, use something
like [DBIx::MultiRow] to encapsulate things. But if, like most of us, you're
on one database for an app, I can't recommend stongly enough how well it pays
to get to know your database well.
