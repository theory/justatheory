Zeynep Tufekci, in [a piece] for *The Atlantic:*

It's the profoundly irresponsible plan to reopen schools without any remotely
sufficient attempt to upgrade and modernize the air circulation systems of our
dilapidated public school buildings that disturbs me. Meanwhile, school
reopening proposals pay undue attention to [hygiene theater] to assuage fears,
while very real risks go largely unaddressed.[^nyc-doe-better] It simply won't
work, and that means disastrous outcomes for communities.

And it's not like there aren't ways to get things under better control. Tufekci
continues:

> However, Japan masked up early, focused on [super-spreader events] (a strategy
> it calls “[cluster busting]”), and, crucially, trained its public to focus on
> avoiding the three C’s—closed spaces, crowded places, and close conversations.
> In other words, exactly the places where airborne transmission and aerosols
> could pose a risk. The Japanese were advised not to talk on the subway, [where
> windows were kept open]. Oshitani said they also developed guidelines that
> included the importance of ventilation in many different settings, such as
> bars, restaurants, and gyms. Six months later, despite having some of the
> earliest outbreaks, ultradense cities, and one of the oldest populations in
> the world, Japan has had about 1,000 COVID-19 deaths total—which is how many
> the United States often has in a single day. Hong Kong, a similarly dense and
> subway-dependent city, has had only 24 deaths.

The U.S. needs to get it shit together. We have the wealth and knowledge to do
this right, but need to put empathy for each other ahead of temporary political
and economic impacts to do so.

  [^nyc-doe-better]: In fairness, the [Health and Safety] section the New York
    City DOE's [Return to School 2020-2021] plan says that the "DOE will make
    improvements to HVAC systems, as well as air conditioning repairs, to
    improve air circulation, as well as replacing regular air filters with
    higher efficiency types." Still, there's a social failing here, national
    leaders ought to fund the upgrading of air circulation systems to the
    highest standards in every school and classroom in the United States.
