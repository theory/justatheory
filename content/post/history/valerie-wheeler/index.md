Two years ago, my undergraduate Anthropology advisor, Professor Valerie Wheeler,
died after a sudden and brief battle with leukemia. She played a vital role
in my academic and personal life, and her passing affected me deeply. Here's
the note I left on her [Legacy page].

> I'm deeply saddened by Valerie's passing. She was more than just my
> undergraduate advisor in the late 80s and early 90s, but also "Mom" to me and
> a slew of my fellow anthropology majors. Such a great, inspiring teacher, who
> taught me to view the world through the lens of culture, so that I saw it in a
> completely new way. It was eye-opening, and had such an impact that I could
> never close them again. And for that, I wanted to do well, to make her proud.
> She expected a lot, and I wanted to meet those expectations. It made me a
> better person, a more thoughtful person. And I could not appreciate it more.
> I'm sorry not to have kept in better touch, and so sad that the world has lost
> such a compassionate, wonderful person. I will carry some of that with me for
> the remainder of my life. Valerie's impact was great, and I'm grateful to have
> had her in my life. My condolences to her family.
