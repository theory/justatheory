Jennifer Kim, in a [Medium post] based on her [Twitter thread]:

> #1 rule: No one should ever be surprised with a “you're fired.” That's how you
> create disgruntled employees, embarrassing Glassdoor reviews, dip in team
> morale, etc. An out-of-the-blue firing is a failing on the *manager's* part,
> not the employees.

So how do you do that? The most important bit:

> 3. **Give them a fair shot to improve.** As a leader, it's your job to try
> to make it work, each employee is owed that.
>
> Practice listening skills. Demonstrate that you believe in them, and you
> *want* to see them improve. Commit to giving a LOT more feedback (specific &
> documented).

If you have little faith that the employee will be able to improve, taking these
and the other steps Jennifer recommends might feel like a waste of time. But
unless the employee's actions involve violence, harassment, fraud, etc., you
need to give them every chance possible for not only their benefit, but *the
benefit of their coworkers.* Of course you don't mention it to your other
employees, but people talk, they know what's going on, and they all need to know
that if they step out of line, you'll support them as much as you can.

In other words, a firing should never come as a surprise to either the employee
getting the sack nor their coworkers. Because worse than negative Glassdoor
reviews is the erosion of trust among the people you continue to work with after
the event.
