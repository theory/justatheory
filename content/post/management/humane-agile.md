[This Jan Wischweh piece] surveying the recent literature on the the so-called
"agile crisis" is a bit of a slog, but these bits caught my attention:

Indeed, management's focus on process and reproducibility (as in [Taylorism])
often drives the adoption of agile development processes. But truly autonomous
agile teams must be empowered to make their own decisions. That means inviting
them to adopt agile practices, rather than imposing those practices on them, and
it means trusting teams to make decisions.

In other words, unilaterally determining team composition, deciding that they'll
do "agile" or "scrum" or "kanban", and reserving the power to override their
decisions perpetuates a traditional focus on repetitive tasks and control,
rather than autonomy and craft. It demonstrates a lack of trust in the team, and
without that trust, the team won't trust management, either --- an untenable,
potentially catastrophic situation. No wonder "Agile" fails so often that we now
have an "agile crisis".

I keep coming back to the fundamental idea that teams are made out of people,
and management should always support, promote, and empower the people in the
company with the autonomy to excel and to do their best work. People over
process.
