I have been unsatisfied with [Just a Theory] for some time. I started that
blog in 2004 more or less for fun, thinking it would be my permanent home on
the internet. And it has been. But the design, while okay in 2004, is just
awful by today's standards. A redesign is something I have planned to do for
quite some time.

I had also been thinking about my audience. Or rather, audiences. I've blogged
about many things, but while a few dear family members might want to read
everything I ever post, most folks, I think, are interested in only a subset
of topics. Readers of [Just a Theory] came for posts about Perl, or
PostgreSQL, or culture, travel, or politics. But few came for all those
topics, in my estimation.

More recently, a whole bunch of top-level domains have opened up, often with
the opportunity for anyone to register them. I was lucky enough to snag
`theory.pm` and `theory.pl`, thinking that perhaps I would create a site just
for blogging about Perl. I also nabbed `theory.so`, which I might dedicate to
database-related blogging, and `theory.me`, which would be my personal blog
(travel, photography, cultural essays, etc.).

And then there is [Octopress]. A blogging engine for hackers. Perfect for me.
Hard to imagine something more appropriate (unless it was written in Perl). It
seemed like a good opportunity to partition my online blogging.

So here we are with my first partition. [theory.pm] is a Perl blog. Seemed
like the perfect name. I fiddled with it off and on for a few months, often
following [Matt Gemmell's Advice], and I'm really happy with it. The
open-source fonts [Source Sans Pro] and [Source Code Pro], from Adobe, look
great. The source code examples are beautifully marked up and displayed using
the [Solarized] color scheme (though presentation varies in feed readers).
Better still, it's equally attractive and readable on computers, tablets and
phones, thanks to the foundation laid by Aron Cedercrantzâ€™s [BlogTheme].

I expect to fork this code to create a database blog soon, and then perhaps
put together a personal blog. Maybe the personal blog will provide link posts
for posts on the other sites, so that if anyone really wants to read
everything, they can. I haven't decided yet.

In the meantime, now that I have a dedicated Perl blog, I guess I'll have to
start writing more Perl-related stuff. I'm starting with some posts about the
state of exception handling in Perl 5, the first of which is [already up]. Stay
tuned for more.

**Update:** 2018-05-23: I decided that a separate Perl blog wasn't a great idea
after all, and [relaunched *Just a Theory*].
