Until last week, I had two newish blogs. This one, [theory.pm], was to be my
Perl blog. The other one, theory.so, was my database blog. I thought it would be
a good idea to have separate blogs for separate audiences, but it turns out I
don't post enough to make much difference. And now, as of last week, I let the
theory.so domain expire. Control the [.so] domain was turned over to Somalia a
few months ago, and domain renewal fees went *way* up. Since I had so few posts
over there (14 since August, 2013), I decided it was a good time to just merge
it with theory.pm and be done with it.

So my apologies if a bunch of my old posts just showed up in your RSS readers.
(You all still use RSS readers, right?). This is a one-time merging of the two
blogs, so should not happen again.

Wellâ€¦maybe. Now I have a total of 25 posts on theory.pm (since July 2013), which
is still pretty paltry. I'm thinking it's silly to have this thing separate from
my original blog, [*Just a Theory*], so I might eventually merge that blog, too.
Not sure what domain I'll use for it. Maybe I'll go back to justatheory.com. Or
maybe I'll use one of the other domains I registered, like the recently added
theory.one. Or maybe theory dot something else.

Not that you care. Good on you for reading this far. I would have stopped before
now. You're a better person than I.

**Update:** 2018-05-23: I merged everything back into [*Just a Theory*] last
week.
