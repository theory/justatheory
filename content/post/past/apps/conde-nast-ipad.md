I've been a [*The New Yorker*] reader for nearly two decades. I'm a huge fan of
the magazine, which in my humble has the best reportage anywhere. So I was
thrilled last year when the magazine's publisher, [Condé Nast], decided to make
all issues available to paper subscribers for no extra charge. Ever since, I
have loved getting the latest issue late on Sunday nights, rather than on the
following Friday or Saturday. It has also made it easier for [Strongrrl] and me
to share the magazine: I usually read the iPad version and she reads the paper
version.

That's not to say that it has all been happiness and joy, mind. *The New Yorker*
app is terrible. Issues are *huge* (typically around 120 MB). Downloads cannot
be performed in the background (except by Newsstand, which may not notice a new
issue for days). You can't even read other issues while waiting for one to
download; the download pauses. Sometimes I have difficulty getting it to start
downloading again. And the navigation, while unique and kind of interesting,
really does not work for me.

Still, I was excited to try it on the new iPad's retina display. Well, "excited"
is not quite the right word. More like "dreading." Because Condé iPad magazines
actually use images for most of their articles, rather than text. The underlying
technology is the charmingly named [Adobe Digital Publishing Suite family],
which, at root, is basically an image reader. Way back in September, 2010,
[Condé told All Things D][]: "The goal is to be all HTML, and we will be." Alas,
that day has yet to come, as I confirmed when I loaded the latest issue of *The
New Yorker* on my new iPad and immediately saw fuzzy text. Sure, the text-based
articles, such as the comment, display beautifully. But longer articles, which
are carefully laid out and rendered as images, do not. They look worse than on
the old iPad, because the anti-aliasing is even easier to see.

I [complained] about this on Twitter, [Brian Lam chimed in], and [Scott Dadich],
Condé's Vice President of Content Innovation, was kind enough to respond:

I suspect that the reality of the overlap of *The New Yorker* and *Vogue*
readers resembles the Venn diagram to the right. But I want to see *The New
Yorker* rock on the iPad, so I put aside some time to download the new *Vogue*
app and take it for a spin.

First, the good news. I got a free month's subscription and downloaded the
latest issue of *Vogue*, which does indeed have hi-res images. The articles look
great. Ads are still low-res, but some might consider that a feature (not, I
daresay, the advertisers). Alas, that's where the good news ends. Overall, this
app is almost exactly like the *The New Yorker* app. I find this a little odd,
since in print the magazines could not be much less different: *The New Yorker*
is a slim, staple-bound, mostly-text weekly. *Vogue* is a phone book-sized
perfect bound, glossy fashion magazine. Quite different beasts. Business-wise, I
can understand why they would be the same: It's less expensive to have a single
"media player" for all of your company's periodical properties, and the tablet
form factor allows you to eliminate some of the differences. After all, bits
don't weigh anything.

Except that they do. The *Vogue* April 2012 issue weighs in at a whopping 408
MB. A special "exclusive download" covering The Met Gala demands 530 MB of disk
space. The latter I can kinda/sorta understand, as it contains a bunch of videos
(all low-res text and image content, though). The fact that the new issue is so
huge tells me that one of two things, or perhaps both, is going on here:

1.  Vogue is such an image-driven magazine that it will just be big no matter
    what you do.
2.  The text content is still images, just bigger ones.

We'll have to wait for the much less image-driven content of *The New Yorker* to
find out if the its downloads are smaller, but the *Vogue* example does not make
me optimistic.

Worse than the download size, though, is the fact that user-triggered downloads
do not happen in the background. I started a download and quit the app, then
came back after 15 minutes of doing other stuff, and it had gone nowhere, though
it restarted the downloading without me needing to do anything more. This is one
of the biggest beefs I've had with *The New Yorker* app: I have to start a
download, and then wait for it to finish, often up to 5 minutes, without being
able to do anything else on my iPad. This sucks.

Other issues I have with the *Vogue* app, and which are also present in the
existing *The New Yorker* app:

-   When not reading an issue, but looking in the "Store" or "My Account," pages
    are quite slow to load. They appear to be web views that download content
    every time they are loaded, with no caching. With hi-res images, it gets
    even slower. It would be nice if these were cached, so that a new download
    would happen only if there was actually new content.
-   Controls can be very slow to respond. I clicked a "Buy Issue" button, and
    nothing happened for 15 seconds. No activity indicator icon, nothing.
    Subsequent taps of the button were a bit better, taking only a second or so
    to respond.
-   Not all controls are obvious. For example, in "My Account," the "Complete
    Account Setup" button is slightly darker than the others, so perhaps
    disabled. But if I tap it, it depresses. But nothing happens. This is quite
    different from how standard iOS controls work, where if a button is
    disabled, its color is greatly reduced and tapping it does nothing.
-   When viewing the high-res magazine, images *and text* start out low-res,
    then sharpen. Clearly we are still dealing with image content, even for the
    text. ([Or perhaps PDFs] and a slow rendering engine. The rendering reminds
    me of the iterative display of progressive JPEGs on the web in the 90s.)
-   Some articles have a Chevron icon for different or related content. If you
    tap one, it jumps to a completely different part of the magazine (think the
    back pages). There is no back arrow.
-   I never cared for the swipe left and right to switch articles/ads, swipe up
    and down for more pages of content. I think it works okay for scrolling
    apps; [Byline] works that way, for example. But not so much for pagination.
    No other reading apps work like that. And since some of the chevron controls
    also scroll left and right, they seem to behave differently but show the
    same animation.
-   Some pages looks as though you ought to be able to tap something, such as an
    invitation to watch a video or a description of an article (especially in
    the "In This Issue" section), but nothing happens when you tap. They really
    ought to respond to taps.
-   Other places are less obvious that should be tapped for more info, but there
    are instructions, such as a little circle in the Special Edition that says
    "tap circle to show caption." I tap the circle and the caption appears,
    right where the tip had been. Why not just show the caption?
-   Some articles have sharing features, where you can share via Twitter,
    Facebook, or email. The Twitter feature connects you to twitter.com in a web
    view, rather than use the iOS 5 Twitter support. Worse, it does not remember
    that I logged in between sessions. So if I tweeted yesterday and want to do
    it again today, I have to log in again. I suspect the Facebook feature works
    the same. Sharing via Email just opens the Mail app, rather than use the
    embedded iOS email controller.
-   When I use the table of contents popover, it is always scrolled to the top,
    no matter how far down the currently-displayed article is or where I left it
    the last time I used it.

There are other issues, as well, some minor, such as the boring grey background
if you make an image or article bounce when you scroll past the end, or the
display of the issue name in the iTunes store as "Vogue Magazine\_200\_30."
Other issues are more annoying, such as the difficulty of discovering and
managing the different types and layers of navigation. But honestly, if just the
following issues were addressed, the app would be *so* much better:

-   Use plain text for layout. HTML would be great.
-   Get the download size down. Reducing the use of images for laying out text
    will help a lot for *The New Yorker,* I'm sure; less perhaps for *Vogue*.
-   Allow the downloads to happen in the background, no matter what else I'm
    doing.
-   Make less use of embedded web browsers for stuff, or at least cache them.
    This is a tablet, with a lot of great features built in. Take advantage of
    them to make the app as responsive as possible!

These steps will help a lot. But even then, I can't help but think that there
continues to be more need for UX exploration and experimentation. A tablet is
*not* a magazine and *not* a web browser, but offers its own features and
constraints. I think a better fit for selling editorial or image-based content
could still be created; these apps don't come close. I can think of three
reasons for why not:

1.  The limitations of the Adobe publishing platform. It's a lowest-common
    denominator experience, in that the player has to work on a bunch of
    different devices, and so would suck on all of them. And it just might not
    have the controls for a strong text-based layout, though I don't see why
    Adobe wouldn't have the resources to address that issue.
2.  The desire for layout integrity. But as [Craig Grannell writes][Or perhaps
    PDFs], that's akin to 90s web sites that were nothing but a single big
    image. It didn't work well for a whole slew of reasons.
3.  Copyright. Plain-text content would just be too easy to "steal," but if it's
    in a PNG, no one will bother. I know nothing about this personally, but it
    would not surprise me if there were folks inside Condé and some of these
    other magazines who don't want to use text-based content because it would be
    too easy to copy.

I find none of these reasons compelling.

Look, I write this out of love. *The New Yorker* is my favorite magazine, bar
none, and I want it to succeed. Print is dying, but there is *so* much
opportunity on devices like the iPad. Continue to create the best content, and
provide it in a form factor and experience that takes advantage of the features
and limitations of your targeted platforms, to allow readers to *enjoy* reading,
and success will be assured.
