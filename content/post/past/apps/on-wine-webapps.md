Alder Yarrow posted [an entry] in his [Vinography] about why the wine tasting
sites, such as [Cork'd], [LogABottle], [Winelog.Net], [TastyDrop], and
[OpenBottles], will ultimately fail. To summarize, his reasons boil down to
these:

1.  There aren't enough wines in the databases
2.  Users don't know how to write
3.  There is no incentive to visit regularly
4.  There aren't enough wine lovers to reach critical mass

Now, I've given this topic some thought, in part because, for a while, I was
planning to write a Webapp to track wine cellar contents and write reviews,
myself. But I recently backburnered it, because of the launch of [Cork'd]. And I
think that, ultimately, Cork'd will be a winner, though not necessarily in the
way that Alder thinks.

Alder assumes that all of these wine sites are trying to build a critical mass
of users and wine reviews to counter the influence of the “Park-tator”. This is
a laudable goal, but I agree likely to fail for all the reasons he mentions.
However, I don't think that this is Cork'd's intent. And the reason Alder misses
this point is because—to borrow terms from [Clay Shirky]—he's still thinking in
terms of “Web School” practices. Cork'd, on the other hand, is “Situated
Software.”

What do I mean by that? The intent of Cork'd is not to amass a huge collection
of wines or reviews, though that may end up being a significant side-effect. Its
intent is to allow users to make recommendations *to their friends.* Cork'd lets
you identify your “drinking buddies” as your own small community within the
larger Cork'd community, and then you can make recommendations to your drinking
buddies. The cool thing about this is that you can ignore the crappy reviews
from the people you don't know or trust, and just collect recommendations from
the people you *do* know and trust.

So users will visit Cork'd because they want to know the preferences of the
people they trust, and will want to share their own recommendations with their
buddies. Creating personal relationships is a much more compelling reason to
return to the application than the old idea of building status among the entire
community. And with their emphasis on sharing with your friends, I don't think
that building a large corpus of content was even something that crossed the
designers' minds when they created Cork'd. They just wanted to have a way to
remember wines that they had recommended to each other, and to let other people
do the same.

So, in a sense, I think that Cork'd *does* address Alder's points, if only by
taking a completely different approach to the Online wine app. Because it's not
a site that's about reviewing wines, it's about sharing with your friends. And
as sites like Flickr and LiveJournal have shown, this is where the action
*really* is.

As a side note, I do think that Vinography's comments about [CellarTracker] are
spot on. It is a potentially powerful resource, but its UI must be the single
worst I've ever seen. *That* was why I was thinking of writing my own Online
Wine app, to be able to keep track of my own cellar and to let others do the
same, but to make it a more enjoyable experience than one can currently get with
CellarTracker. I only wish that I'd thought of so many of the ideas in Cork'd a
year ago and made it happen, so that I could get the benefits of Cork'd *and*
track my own wines like I could with CellarTracker. But for now, I'm just
sending feature requests to Cork'd and watching to see how things develop.
