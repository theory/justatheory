After a couple of weeks of hard work, with lots of assistance from
[Marshall Roch], I'm just about ready to launch the new Bricolage Website.
Thanks to hardware and hosting provided by [NetStumbler.com], we now have a
fully functioning Bricolage installation and Web server for the bricolage.cc
domain.

The new site will launch just before my OSCON talk on Wednesday. In addition to
having the great Web standards-compliant layout (thanks Marshall!) and a decent
amount of extra content, the templates for the site will be made available for
download, too. The templates will make a great “best practices” example, both
for bricoleurs and Bricolage evaluators. I think they nicely show off the
flexibility of the Bricolage CMS platform.

So do you want to see the beta? I'm making it available only to my fellow
Bricolage developers and to you, the readers of my blog. Just point your browser
at [www.bricolage.cc], and then just `s/www/beta/` to see the new site. I'm not
providing a direct link to it here because it's going to go away on Wednesday
and I don't want to get any 404s. Feel free to send me feedback on the new
site--anything about it: design, layout, XHTML, CSS, etc.
