I can't believe I haven't posted this story here yet! I guess I've been busy. So
here it is:

*eWeek* has [reviewed][] [Bricolage], the Perl-powered, PostgreSQL-backed
open-source content management system. The article was published last week. An
excerpt:

> Bricolage is quite possibly the most capable enterprise-class open-source
> application available. The Web content management application features
> excellent administration capabilities, and it is highly extensible and capable
> of managing even the biggest and most complex Web sites. As an open-source
> product, Bricolage is free, and companies can now purchase support and
> development services from Kineticode.

The article is part of the [“Content Management Face-Off”] in the current issue
of *eWeek*:

> Included in this evaluation are the open-source Bricolage 1.8.1, Interwoven
> Inc.'s TeamSite 6.1, CrownPeak Technology Inc.'s Advantage CMS, Serena
> Software Inc.'s Collage 4.5, PaperThin Inc.'s CommonSpot Content Server 4.0
> and Ektron Inc.'s CMS300 4.5. (The reviews are ordered, roughly, from the high
> end to the low end of the content management market.)

I'm pretty stoked about this review, as you might imagine. *eWeek* is now
officially my favorite trade magazine!
