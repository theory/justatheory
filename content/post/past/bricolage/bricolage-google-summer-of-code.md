The Bricolage project is pleased to have been selected to be a partner in the
Google [Summer of Code]. This Initiative is designed to introduce students to
the world of Open Source Software Development and provide them with a $4500
award for completing an Open Source project before the end of Summer.

As a partner, we are currently looking for student volunteers to propose
Bricolage development projects. We have created a [list of suggested project
ideas]. If you're interested in hacking on Bricolage for fame and fortune, join
the [Bricolage Developers] mail list or sign on to `#bricolage` on
irc.develooper.org (MagNet) to outline your proposal and get feedback as you
prepare to submit it to Google. You can also join the Google [Summer-Discuss]
group or sign on to `#google-summer` on irc.freenode.net for more general
discussion of the Summer of Code.

But hurry, the deadline for proposal submissions is June 14! Students who get
Bricolage projects accepted will be mentored by me and other members of the
Bricolage community.

We look forward to your proposals!
