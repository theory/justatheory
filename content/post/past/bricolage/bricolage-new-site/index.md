The launch of the new [Bricolage Website] went off without a hitch yesterday.
The lack of sleep getting it all just so was worth it, in the end. And I'm very
very pleased with the new site. It looks good, it's easy to navigate, it has
really nice semantic XHTML 1.1 that degrades nicely in older browsers (check it
out in Netscape Navigator 4.x or in `lynx`!

The new content on the site is good, too. There's a lot more information for
people who have heard of Bricolage and are hitting the site for the first time
to try to learn something about it. We now explain what it is and what it's for
on the home page, and have a nice set of pages describing the benefits of
Bricolage, listing the sites known to be powered by Bricolage, and providing
screenshots to give folks a feel for how nice the Bricolage UI is. Special
thanks to [Marshall Roch] for providing the new design and the home page
content.

This is the first Bricolage Website to be managed in Bricolage itself. I decided
to create the new site for a number of reasons, but two of the more important
ones were: to have a nice example for conference and client presentations; and
to be able to release the Bricolage Mason templates that generate the site.
These templates have now been released and are available for [download] on the
Bricolage Website. I've worked hard to try to make them really good examples of
best practices in using Bricolage so that people can download them, study them,
and be able to start writing smart templates for their on Bricolage
implementations. So enjoy!
