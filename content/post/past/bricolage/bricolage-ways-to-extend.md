Going through the latest version of the Bricolage 2.0 technical specification, I
can see at least six ways that developers will easily be able to extend
Bricolage:

Write a new task by subclassing Bricolage::Biz::Task
:   A task can be designed to do just about anything to a single Bricolage
    object. Hell, you'd be able to look up other objects, too, so anything's
    possible. Tasks are run by scheduled jobs, event-triggered actions, or by
    distribution jobs.

Create a new data type by subclassing Bricolage::Biz::Value and Bricolage::Biz::Type::Value
:   We'll support quite a few different value types to start with, but we
    couldn't anticipate everything, so this'll be your chance!

Create a new UI widget by subclassing Bricolage::Widget and Bricolage::Biz::Type::Widget
:   Maybe your new value requires its own special widget. Or maybe you don't
    like the way the existing widgets handle other types of values. So write
    your own!

Write a new distribution mover by subclassing Bricolage::Biz::Dist::Mover
:   We'll start out with file system copy, SFTP, SFTP, and WebDAV distribution
    movers just as we have in Bricolage 1.8, but there's always room for more!

Write a new authentication plugin by subclassing Bricolage::Util::Auth
:   The built-in and LDAP-based authentication systems aren't doing it for you?
    You want to authenticate against a different database? Make it so!

Write a new storage back-end by subclassing Bricolage::Store
:   We'll have a PostgreSQL back-end from the start, and perhaps SQLite and/or
    MySQL. But here's your chance to get Bricolage running on FileMaker Pro just
    as you've always secretly desired!

So have fun with it! When it gets here. Want to help get get here? Subscribe to
