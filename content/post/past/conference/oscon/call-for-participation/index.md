I just saw that the OSCON 2006 [Call for Participation] has gone up. Deadline is
February 13, 2006. I've been thinking about some of the things I'd like to see:

-   The PostgreSQL equivalent of [this presentation], in which Flickr's John
    Allspaw (hi John!) offers up advice on how to configure hardware,
    replication, and proxies for a busy MySQL-based site. Can [Slony-I] scale
    out in the same way? How does it work? I'd love to see someone who's had to
    make a busy PostgreSQL-based site scale up to massive load tell us how it
    was done.

-   Something about an open-source JavaScript library project. I know that there
    are a number of them, each with its advantages and disadvantages. I'd love
    to see a successful, general repository for reusable, [well-tested]
    JavaScript libraries. Me, as a Perl guy, I'm partial to the CPAN model,
    which has been enormously successful. Will [JSAN] have similar success?

I'm sure I'll think of others in the coming weeks. What ideas do you have? Post
them below!
