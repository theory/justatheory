My [presentation] went off well yesterday. It was in a small room, and I was
delighted to find that it was standing room only. Several people told me later
that they weren't able to even get into the room. I told [Nat] that next year
he'd have to give me a keynote.

This is a new version of my usual presentation. It simplifies some things, and
uses the new [Bricolage Website] for its example. I think that it was positively
received. I've worked hard to try to make the presentation engaging, and it was
nice that I didn't lose my audience; no one left during the presentation that I
noticed (although it was mighty crowded in the back!). So I'm happy with it.

I exported the presentation to PDF, and added the movie that runs at the
beginning as a set of slides ahead of the main presentation content. You can
[download] the presentation from the [Kineticode] Website.
