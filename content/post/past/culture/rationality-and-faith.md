I got an invitation to write on [Medium] a couple weeks ago. I have been
pondering some more philosophical posts lately, so I thought I’d try posting
there. My first post, “[Misguided Delusion],” tries to pull apart the the false
dichotomy between faith and rationality. Yeah, really. That kind of thinking is
a throwback to a [previous career path], but one that has, of course, always
stuck with me. And I am very happy with how the post turned out.

It remains to be seen whether or not I write more stuff like that. It’s
rewarding, but time-consuming.
