I've had reason to think about database change management lately. While I was
working on Rails apps, I of course made use of [migrations]. These were an
improvement over what I'd been doing with [Bricolage upgrade scripts], in the
sense that the system kept track of what version you were on (where “version”
means “numeric sequence of migration scripts”) and applied whatever had a higher
number than was last applied. But Rails migrations leave a number of things to
be desired, not least of which that they support a very small subset of SQL and
require that you write the migrations in Ruby (sure I could embed SQL, and I
did, but it was still Ruby and thus not able to integrate with, say, [Slony-I]).

Inspired by Rails migrations, last summer I wrote some code for a customer that
did essentially the same thing, except that the migration scripts were pure SQL
scripts rather than Ruby (or Perl or whatever). I did this by subclassing
[Module::Build] to add a “db” action. So for a deployment, you could do this:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build db
    sudo ./Build install

And it would do the right thing, tracking which migration scripts had been run
by their numeric prefixes and updating a metadata record for each one. And that
worked great…except when it came to maintaining database functions and
procedures.

The problem in a nut-shell is this: Database functions are [amazingly useful];
they greatly [simplify client interfaces] and [improve performance]. But
managing them in migration scripts is a recipe for a *ton* of code duplication.
Why? Because--unlike your Perl or Ruby code or whatever, which you just modify
in a library file and commit to your version control system--every time you have
to modify a function, you have to paste the entire fucking thing in a new
migration script and make your changes there.

Try to imagine, for a moment, what that means for a function such as the
`recurring_events_for()` function in my piece on [generating recurring events in
the database][amazingly useful]. Say there was a bug in the function, where it
was failing to return some instances of events that fall between the recurrence
dates. A simple patch might look something like this:

``` diff
@@ -22,7 +22,10 @@
                   recurrence <> 'none'
               OR  (
                      recurrence = 'none'
-                 AND starts_at BETWEEN range_start AND range_end
+                 AND (
+                         starts_at BETWEEN range_start AND range_end
+                      OR ends_at   BETWEEN range_start AND range_end
+                 )
               )
           )
     LOOP
```

Pretty straight-forward, right? But *not for migration scripts!*. To make this
three-line change with migrations, I'd actually have to paste the entire 58-line
function into a new migration script, make the changes and then commit. There
are at least two problems with this approach: 1) A huge amount of code
duplication for no good reason; and 2) No real change management! Someone
looking at [SVN::Notify] notifications would not easily be able to see what
changed, because the diff does not show what lines changed in the function, only
that a whole new file with a whole new function was added. Yikes!

And it can get worse than this. For a client I'm currently working with, the
state of the production database is tracked in Subversion by running a nightly
`cron` job that dumps the database schema to a file and checks it into
subversion. Migration scripts are written in pure SQL and named with bug
numbers, but once they are pushed to production, *the bloody migration scripts
are deleted because the nightly schema dump reflects the changes!*. So, for
function updates, the are committed to Subversion en masse *twice!*

So I'd like to propose a different approach to database change management. Or,
rather, a more diversified approach.

First, you can have numbered migration scripts. This works very well for simple
schema changes, like adding a table, column, foreign key, or index, because the
SQL statements that get committed in the scripts describe exactly what they're
doing. `ALTER` statements are uncomplicated, and show only what they're
altering. You can also easily write downgrade migration scripts to use in case
something goes wrong, just by using the same script number in a different
directory. So you'd have something like this:

    sql/
    sql/migrations/
    sql/migrations/up/
    sql/migrations/up/001-create_user_table.sql
    sql/migrations/up/002-add_fk_for_user.sql
    sql/migrations/down/
    sql/migrations/down/001-drop_user_table.sql
    sql/migrations/down/002-drop_fk_for_user.sql

That's the first part, not unlike how Rails migrations work or the stuff I wrote
for a client last year. But then there's a second set of migration scripts.
These are managed like Perl or Ruby libraries or what-have-you, such that you
can just add and/or change files as necessary. It might look like this, with one
database function or procedure per file:

    sql/migrations/lib/
    sql/migrations/lib/generate_recurrences.sql
    sql/migrations/lib/recurring_events_for.sql

Each of these files has one function defined using `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION`.
This means that they can be run over and over again without problem. If I run
into a bug in my `recurring_events_for()` function, I just change it in
`recurring_events_for.sql`, commit it, and I'm done.

The code that handles the database build can then track both the migration
number *and* the timestamp for the last commit migrated in the
`sql/migrations/lib` directory. Once the numbered migrations are run, it can
then decide what `lib` migrations to run by looking for those that have been
modified since the last time migrations were run. In Perl, using Git, that'd be
something like this:

``` perl
sub run {
    my $cmd = shift;
    map { s/^\s+//; s/\s+$//; $_ } `$cmd`;
}

my $lib = 'lib';
my $date = '2009-04-01 00:01:00';
my ($rev) = run "git rev-list --reverse --since='$date' master -- '$lib'";

for my $script (
    map  { $_->[0] }
    sort { $a->[1] cmp $b->[1] }
    map  { chomp; [ $_ => run "git log -1 --pretty=format:%ci '$_'" ]  }
    run "git diff --name-only $rev^ '$lib'"
) {
    system qw(psql -f), $script;
}
```

First, we get the oldest revision SHA1 ID since the specified date and store it
in `$rev`. The magic is in the `for` loop which, due to the antiquity of Perl
list functions, you must read bottom-to-top (aside: this can be rectified by
[autoboxing]). We use `git diff --name-only` to get a list of all the files
changed in the directory since just before that revision. For file each, we get
the date of the most recent commit, sort on the date, and then apply the
migration by passing it to `psql -f`.

In reality, the code should also update the metadata table in the database with
the date of each script as it's applied -- but only if it succeeds. If it fails,
we just die. If you needed to migrate down, the code could just check out the
files as they were at `$rev^` and apply them. Yeah, use the change management
interface to go back in time: who'da thought it?

Anyway, that's the idea. I think I'll implement this for an internal app I've
been hacking on and off, just to see what kinds of issues might come up. Anyone
else thought of something like this? Maybe there's something already out there?
I'm not interested in automatic migrations like [DBIx::Class Schema migrations],
as I don't rely on ORMs anymore (probably should blog that one of these days,
too). I'm just curious what other approaches folks have taken to database change
management. Let me know.
