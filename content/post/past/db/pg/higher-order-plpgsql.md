Well, it's not *really* higher-order PL/pgSQL, since the language doesn't
support [closures], as far as I know. But I have been working on a series of
articles for [O'Reilly Databases] site, drawing inspiration from Mark Jason
Dominus's [*Higher-Order Perl*], and specifically using the Fibonacci sequence
to create example PL/pgSQL functions. It turns out that, while the Fibonacci
sequence may not be of much use in day-to-day database work, it makes for great
pedagogy. And I learned a fair bit along the way, as well.

So the initial, naïve implementation of a Fibonacci calculate in PL/pgSQL, using
recursion, is quite straight-forward:

``` postgres
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fib (
    fib_for int
) RETURNS integer AS $$
BEGIN
    IF fib_for < 2 THEN
        RETURN fib_for;
    END IF;
    RETURN fib(fib_for - 2) + fib(fib_for - 1);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

Pretty simple, right? The “$$”, by the way, is PL/pgSQL dollar-quoting, which
prevents me from having to escape single quotes in the function body (when the
function body has them, that is!). of course, this is as slow in PL/pgSQL as it
would be in any other language:

    try=% explain analyze select fib(26);
    ----------------------------
     Total runtime: 3772.315 ms

Pretty sad, right? So then I added memoization. In PL/pgSQL, this is as simple
as using a table for the cache:

``` postgres
CREATE TABLE fib_cache (
        num integer PRIMARY KEY,
        fib integer NOT NULL
);

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fib_cached(
    fib_for int
) RETURNS integer AS $$
DECLARE
    ret integer;
BEGIN
    if fib_for < 2 THEN
        RETURN fib_for;
    END IF;

    SELECT INTO ret fib
    FROM   fib_cache
    WHERE  num = fib_for;

    IF ret IS NULL THEN
        ret := fib_cached(fib_for - 2) + fib_cached(fib_for - 1);
        INSERT INTO fib_cache (num, fib)
        VALUES (fib_for, ret);
    END IF;
    RETURN ret;

END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;CREATE TABLE fib_cache (
        num integer PRIMARY KEY,
        fib integer NOT NULL
);

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fib_cached(
    fib_for int
) RETURNS integer AS $$
DECLARE
    ret integer;
BEGIN
    if fib_for < 2 THEN
        RETURN fib_for;
    END IF;

    SELECT INTO ret fib
    FROM   fib_cache
    WHERE  num = fib_for;

    IF ret IS NULL THEN
        ret := fib_cached(fib_for - 2) + fib_cached(fib_for - 1);
        INSERT INTO fib_cache (num, fib)
        VALUES (fib_for, ret);
    END IF;
    RETURN ret;

END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

This gets me a big performance boost:

    try=% explain analyze select fib_cached(26);
    --------------------------
     Total runtime: 50.889 ms

    try=% explain analyze select fib_cached(26);
    --------------------------
     Total runtime: 2.249 ms

So even before any sequence numbers have been calculated it's a big win, and
after they've been calculated, it is of course even better.

So then, following Dominus's lead, I set about refactoring the original,
recursive version with tail call elimination. Here's what I came up with:

``` postgres
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fib_stacked(
    n integer
) RETURNS integer AS $$
DECLARE
    fib_for integer := n;
    branch  integer := 0;
    ret     integer := 0;
    s1      integer := 0;
    stack   integer[][] := ARRAY[ARRAY[0, 0, 0]];
    bound   integer := 1;
BEGIN
    LOOP
        IF fib_for < 2 THEN
            ret := fib_for;
        ELSE
            IF branch = 0 THEN
                WHILE fib_for >= 2 LOOP
                    stack = array_cat(stack, ARRAY[1, 0, fib_for]);
                    fib_for := fib_for - 1;
                END LOOP;
                ret := fib_for;
            ELSIF branch = 1 THEN
                stack = array_cat(stack, ARRAY[2, ret, fib_for]);
                fib_for := fib_for - 2;
                branch  := 0;
                CONTINUE;
            ELSIF branch = 2 THEN
                ret := ret + s1;
            END IF;
        END IF;

        bound := array_upper(stack, 1);
        IF bound <= 1 THEN
            RETURN ret;
        END IF;

        SELECT INTO branch,          s1,              fib_for
                    stack[bound][1], stack[bound][2], stack[bound][3];
        SELECT INTO stack stack[1:bound-1][1:3];
    END LOOP;
    RETURN ret;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

It took me *forever* to figure out how to do it, primarily because arrays in
PostgreSQL are quite limited, in the sense that, while can add to them, you
cannot remove from them! Hence the `SELECT INTO` to reassign to `stack` at the
end of the loop. That syntax constructs a completely new, smaller array and
assigns it to `stack`. Ick. Another problem is that PL/pgSQL does not like an
empty multidimensional array; hence the initial assignment to `stack` in the
`DECLARE` block. I then have to remember that the array always has at least one
item in it, and respond accordingly. It didn't much help that SQL arrays start
at 1 rather than 0.

But the big surprise to me was just how badly this function performed:

    try=% explain analyze select fib_stacked(26);
    -----------------------------
     Total runtime: 30852.697 ms

Yow! So I don't think that's the best approach. But I did figure out another
approach, based on an example I saw in *Agile Web Development with Rails*. It's
a very simple loop-based approach:

``` postgres
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fib_fast(
    fib_for int
) RETURNS integer AS $$
DECLARE
    ret integer := 0;
    nxt integer := 1;
    tmp integer;
BEGIN
    FOR num IN 1..fib_for LOOP
        tmp := ret;
        ret := nxt;
        nxt := tmp + nxt;
    END LOOP;

    RETURN ret;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

This one works the best of all:

    try=# explain analyze select fib_fast(26);
    -------------------------
     Total runtime: 0.326 ms

Sweet! I was left wondering why this algorithm wasn't used in *HOP*, but then
realized that it probably didn't fit in with Dominus's pedagogical goals. But it
was an interesting learning experience for me all the same.

Look for the first of my articles to be published 2006-5-10.
