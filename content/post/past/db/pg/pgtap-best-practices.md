Last month I gave two presentations at the [PostgreSQL Conference West]. The
first was a variation on [Unit Test Your Database!], which I've now given about
six times (and will at least two more times, including tomorrow night for
[Portland PLUG] and in two weeks at the [JPUG 10th Anniversary Conference]). The
second was a new talk, a 90-minute tutorial, called “pgTAP Best Practices.” And
here it is, published on Slideshare. Enjoy.

You can also download a 76MB [PDF] if that's more your style.

Enjoy!
