Last month I gave two presentations at the [PostgreSQL Conference West]. The
first was a variation on [Unit Test Your Database!], which I've now given about
six times (and will at least two more times, including tomorrow night for
[Portland PLUG] and in two weeks at the [JPUG 10th Anniversary Conference]). The
second was a new talk, a 90-minute tutorial, called “pgTAP Best Practices.” And
here it is ([download] and [Slideshare]). Enjoy!
