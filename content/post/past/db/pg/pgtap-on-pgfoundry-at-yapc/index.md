A couple of quick announcements:

pgTAP on pgFoundry

:   First, the PostgreSQL community approved my project, so now there is a
    [pgTAP project page], including a couple of [mail lists], a [bug tracker],
    and [downloads]. I uploaded a new version shortly after the project was
    approved, and 0.03 should be there soon, as well.

pgTAP YAPC::NA Lightning Talk

:   I gave a [Lightning talk] at YAPC::NA 2008 in Chicago this afternoon. I've
    now posted [the slides] for your enjoyment.

Care to help me with development? Want to add your own test functions or make it
all integrate better with standard PostgreSQL regression tests? Want to help me
get Module::Build or Module::Install to run Perl and PostgreSQL and whatever
tests side-by-side, all at once? Join the [pgtap-users] mail list and join the
fun!
