The talk that I [announced] a couple of days ago went off very well, I think.
Rich Shepard, a local PostgreSQL who was at the meeting, later said on the mail
list:

Wow, praise doesn't get much higher than that. I'm glad the group got a lot out
of the presentation. For the benefit of those who couldn't make it, I've [posted
the slides] for your enjoyment. They might be a bit hard to follow at times
without my commentary, but you should be able to fill in the gaps by reading
[my][] [articles] for O'Reilly.

So start having some fun with PL/pgSQL!
