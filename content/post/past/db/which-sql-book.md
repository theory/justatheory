So, what advanced SQL book should I buy? I've learned a lot about SQL over the
last year or so, but I'm sure that [Josh Berkus] is tired of being my own
personal advanced SQL reference. So I'd like to really learn more about
triggers, stored procedures, rules, views, and whatnot, what they're best used
for and when to use them. And other typical database features that I'm not
familiar with, of course.

What I *don't* need is an introduction to SQL. There are a million of those, and
they all have much the same stuff. I want to really get into advanced concepts.

So what's the best choice? Leave me a comment with your opinion. Thanks!
