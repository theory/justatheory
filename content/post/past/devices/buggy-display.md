A few days ago, I noticed a bug crawling across the screen of my MacBook Pro as
I was working. I tried to shoo it away, but it wouldn't budge—because it was
*inside* the display! It soon stopped moving, and is right smack in the middle
of the screen, where I try to work. So I have an Apple Genius appointment today
to see about extracting it. Here's hoping they have the tools to remove it at
the store (an [aardvark], perhaps?), else I'll have to part with it for a week.
Grrr.

For old time's sake, I also dug up and re-posted my [cracked PowerBook display]
entry from way back in 2095. Good times.
