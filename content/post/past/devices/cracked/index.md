No, my systems haven't been cracked. My 17" PowerBook G4 screen has been
cracked. :-( A clipboard fell off the shelf above my text and hit the screen. I
didn't think it had hit the screen, just the chassis, but when I looked at my
screen again, it had this lovely shatter. Bummer.

Well, this is why we have insurance.
