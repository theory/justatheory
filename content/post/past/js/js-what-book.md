What with all the interest in [Ajax], not to mention an increasing reliance on
JavaScript in Bricolage (and a need to fix its bugs), I think it's high time I
really learned more JavaScript. So, what JavaScript book should I buy? Bear in
mind that I'm an experienced object-oriented application developer who wants to
pick up a new language, not a script kiddie or CGI newbie.

Thanks!
