<p>What with all the interest in <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php" title="Adaptive Path has your Ajax porn right here!">Ajax</a>, not to mention
an increasing reliance on JavaScript in Bricolage (and a need to fix its
bugs), I think it's high time I really learned more JavaScript. So, what
JavaScript book should I buy? Bear in mind that I'm an experienced
object-oriented application developer who wants to pick up a new language, not
a script kiddie or CGI newbie.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
