I'm pleased to announce the second alpha release of TestSimple, the port of
[Test::Builder, Test::Simple, and Test::More] to JavaScript. You can download it
[here]. This release has the following changes:

-   Removed `eqArray()` and `eqAssoc()` functions from TestMore per suggestion
    from Michael Schwern. The problem is that these are not test functions, and
    so are inconsistent with the way the rest of the functions work.
    `isDeeply()` is the function that users really want.
-   Changed `eqSet()` to `isSet()` and made it into a real test function.
-   Implemented `skip()`, `todoSkip()`, and `todo()`. These are a bit different
    than the Perl originals originals so read the docs!
-   Implemented `skipAll()` and `BAILOUT()` using exceptions and an exception
    handler installed in `window.onerror`.
-   The final message of a test file now properly outputs in the proper place.
    Tests must be run inside an element its “id” attribute set to “test”, such
    as `<pre id="test">`. The `window.onload` handler will find it and append
    the final test information.
-   Implemented `skipRest()` in TestBuilder and TestMore. This method is stubbed
    out the Perl original, but not yet implemented there!

The only truly outstanding issues I see before I would consider these “modules”
ready for production use are:

-   Figure out how to get at file names and line numbers for better diagnostic
    messages. Is this even possible in JavaScript?
-   Decide where to send test output, and where to allow other output to be
    sent. Test::Builder clones `STDERR` and `STDOUT` for this purpose. We'll
    probably have to do it by overriding `document.write()>`, but it'd be good
    to allow users to define alternate outputs (tests may not always run in a
    browser, eh?). Maybe we can use an output object? Currently, a browser and
    its DOM are expected to be present. I could really use some advice from real
    JavaScript gurus on this one.
-   Write tests!

Feedback/advice/insults welcome!
