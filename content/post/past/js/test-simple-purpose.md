In response to my [TestSimple 0.03 announcement], Bill N1VUX asked a number of
important questions about TestSimple's purpose. Since this is just an alpha
release and I'm still making my way though the port, I haven't created a project
page or started to promote it much, yet. Once I get the harness part written and
feel like it's stable and working well, I'll likely start to promote it as
widely as possible.

But yes, TestSimple is designed for doing unit testing in JavaScript. Of all the
JavaScript I've seen, I've never seen any decent unit tests. People sometimes
write a few integration tests to test them in browsers, but don't write many
tests that would ensure that their JS code runs where they need it to run and
that would give them the freedom to refactor. There is generally very little
coverage in JavaScript tests—if there are any tests at all.

While it's true that JavaScript is nearly always an *embedded* language (but see
also [Rhino] and [SpiderMonkey]), that doesn't mean that one doesn't write a lot
of JavaScript functions or classes that need testing. It's also important to
have a lot of tests you can run in various browsers (just as you can run tests
of a Perl module on various OSs and various versions of Perl). I started the
port because, as I was learning JavaScript, I realized that I didn't want to
write much without writing tests. The purpose is to ensure the quality of
JavaScript code as it goes through the development process. And the freedom to
refactor that tests offer is very important for my personal development style.

So, to answer N1VUX's questions:

> Is the point to integration test the whole distributed front-ends of
> applications from the (EcmaScript compliant) browser?

Yes. And I expect that, as people write more JavaScript applications, there will
be a lot more code that needs testing. However, unlike other JavaScript testing
frameworks I've seen (all based on the xUnit framework), my suite doesn't assume
that tests will be run in a browser. Ultimately, I'd like to be able to automate
tests outside of browsers—or by scripting browsers. But in the meantime, it will
produce TAP-compliant output in the browser, and I plan on implementing a
harness that will run all of your test scripts in a single browser window and
output the results, just like Test::Harness does for Perl modules on the
command-line.

> Or to unit test the client-side java-script as an entity, mocking the server??

Yes, I would like to be able to do that eventually. I will likely mock the
server by mocking XMLHttpRequest and Microsoft.XMLHTTP to return XML strings
that can be used for testing. Stuff like that.

> Or is the point to Unit test JavaScript functions in the browser *in vitro,*
> mocking everything outside the current function?

If need be, yes. The point is that you have the freedom to do it the way that
makes sense to your particular project. The testing framework itself doesn't
care where it's run or how.

> Or is this for Unit Testing of the Presentation Layer on the server from the
> Browser? (If so, how can a JavaScript arrange to Mock the Model layer?)

Probably not, but again, it depends on the model of your application. I've tried
to make no assumptions, just provide you with the tools to easily test your
application. I hope and expect that others will start creating the appropriate
JavaScript libraries to start mocking whatever other APIs one needs to fully
unit test JavaScript code that relies on such libraries.

That was my initial impetus, yes.

Yes, as more people follow Google's lead, more and more applications will be
appearing in JavaScript, and they will require a lot of code. JavaScript already
supports a prototype-based object-orientation scheme, and if [JavaScript 2.0]
ever becomes a reality (please, please, please, please *please!*), then we'll
have real [classes], [namespaces], and even [`import`], [`include`] and [`use`]!
Testing will become increasingly important as more organizations come to rely on
growing amounts of production JavaScript code.
