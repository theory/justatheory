I've had an open policy on comments on this blog since it started. A couple
years ago, I added a timeout on trackback pings, so that you can't trackback
ping a posting more than two weeks after I wrote it. But I left manual comments
in, along with the simple math bit, since comments and spam have been low
volume.

Curiously, though, although this is not a popular blog, and I've posted to it
all of twice in the last six months, I've been getting a lot more comment spam
in the last few weeks. I've been having to manually delete upwards of 100 spam
comments a day. Well, I'm bored with that. So I hereby announce a new comment
policy: You can comment on a blog post for up to two weeks after I post it.
After that, the comment period will be over. I'm sorry to have to do this, and
maybe it will change if I ever switch to Word Press or something, but for now, I
think it will do.

The vast majority of non-spam comments I get on any particular post after two
weeks or so is a request for support. So I don't think that the new policy will
hamper anyone much, and for those looking for support, well, this is not the
appropriate forum. But if you *do* feel compelled to comment on something after
the comment period, just email your comment to me and I'll add it in as I deem
appropriate.

Thanks for understanding. I really appreciate getting this time back every day.
And, of course, if you'd like to respond to this new policy in any way, well,
you have two weeks to leave a comment on this post. ;-)
