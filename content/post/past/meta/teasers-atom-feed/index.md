I've just added a new feed: [teasers only]. It makes things a log shorter for
those who just want to get a teaser for each blog entry, rather than [complete
entries], such as [Planet Perl] and [Planet PostgreSQL].

Any questions or problems? Leave a comment. Thanks!

  [teasers only]: {{% link "/index.atomsum" %}}
  [complete entries]: {{% ref "/" "atom" %}}
  [Planet Perl]: http://planet.perl.org
  [Planet PostgreSQL]: http://www.planetpostgresql.org/
