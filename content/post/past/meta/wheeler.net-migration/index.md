I've completed the migration of all of the content from my old site,
david.wheeler.net. All requests to that domain will get a permanent redirect to
this site. Where possible, I tried to make the old URLs redirect to the new
URLs. So if you try to connect to [david.wheeler.net/osx.html], you should be
automatically redirected to
[www.justatheory.com/computers/os/macosx/my\_adventures.html]. The same goes for
the following documents:

-   [Patch for Apache + DBM on Mac OS X]
-   [Migrating to Mac OS X]
-   [Patch for mod\_ssl on Mac OS X]

If you happen to notice that I missed anything, comment on this blog entry to
let me know.
