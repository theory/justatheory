Following a very good [suggestion from Pedro Melo], I've created a Git
repository for this tutorial and put it [on GitHub]. I replayed each step,
making each into its own [commit], and tagged the state of the code for each
entry:

-   [Create Catalyst Views with Template::Declare]
-   [Catalyst with DBIx::Connector and Template::Declare]
-   [Create a Template::Declare Wrapper]
-   [My Catalyst Tutorial: Add Authors to the View]

So as I continue to make modifications, I'll keep this repository up-to-date,
and tag things as of each blog entry. This will make it easy for you to follow
along; you can simply clone [the repository] and `git pull` for each post.

More soon.
