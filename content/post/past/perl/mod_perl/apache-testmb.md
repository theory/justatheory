Over the last couple of days, I whipped up a new class to be added to the
[Apache HTTP Test Project]. The new class, `Apache::TestMB`, is actually a
subclass of [`Module::Build`], and finally provides support for using
`Apache::Test` with `Module::Build`. You use it just like `Module::Build`;
however, since a lot of modules choose to install themselves even if Apache
isn't installed (because they can be used both inside and outside of `mod_perl`,
e.g., [HTML::Mason]), I'm suggesting that *Build.PL* files look like this:

``` perl
use Module::Build;

my $build_pkg = eval { require Apache::TestMB }
  ? "Apache::TestMB" : "Module::Build";

my $build = $build_pkg->new(
  module_name => "My::Module",
)->create_build_script;
```

Pretty simple, huh? To judge by the [discussion], it will soon be committed to
the `Apache::Test` repository and released to CPAN. My
[`MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks`] module will debut with a new
`Apache::TestMB`-powered *Build.PL* soon afterward.
