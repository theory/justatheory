So I just learned about and subscribed to the [CPAN-Testers feed for my modules].
There appear to be a number of odd failures. Take [this one]. It says,“Can't
locate Algorithm/Diff.pm,” despite the fact that I have properly specified the
requirement for `Text::Diff`, which itself properly requires `Algorithm::Diff.`.
Is this an instance of `CPAN.pm` or `CPANPLUS` not following all prerequisites,
or what?

Or take [this failure]. It says, “\[CP\_ERROR\] \[Mon Sep 5 09:32:08 2005\] No
such module 'mod\_perl' found on CPAN”. Yet [here it is]. Maybe the `CPANPLUS`
indexer has a bug? Or are people's configurations just horked? Or am I just
doing something braindead?

Opinions welcomed.
