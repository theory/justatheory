So [SVN::Notify] doesn't currently run on Windows. Why not? Well, because I
wanted to do things as “rightly” as possible. In terms of efficiency, what that
meant was, rather than slurping in whole chunks of data, such as diffs, from
*svnlook*, I instead follows the guidance in [perlipc] to open a file handle
pipe to *svnlook* and then read from it line-by-line. The method I wrote to
create the pipe looks like this:

``` perl
sub _pipe {
    my ($self, $mode) = (shift, shift);
    # Safer version of backtick (see perlipc(1)).
    local *PIPE;
    my $pid = open(PIPE, $mode);
    die "Cannot fork: $!\n" unless defined $pid;

    if ($pid) {
        # Parent process. Return the file handle.
        return *PIPE;
    } else {
        # Child process. Execute the commands.
        exec(@_) or die "Cannot exec $_[0]: $!\n";
        # Not reached.
    }
}
```

The problem is that it doesn't work on Windows. perlipc says:

'Course, the SEE ALSO section doesn't have much of for “alien systems,” but I
have a comment in my code that suggests that [Win32::Process] might do for
Windows compatibility. But I honestly don't know.

So what's the best approach for me to port SVN::Notify to Windows while keeping
file handle pipes around for efficiency? Anyone care to take a stab at it, with
tests for Winows, and send me a patch?
