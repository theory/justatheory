I grabbed the [LdapOverlay] solution for using an LDAP server to authenticate
against [Request Tracker] today in my continuing efforts to use LDAP for single
sign-on for all Kineticode resources. It worked great, but I wanted a couple
more things out of it, namely TLS communications with the LDAP server (so that
all communications are encrypted), and authentication only for members of a
certain LDAP group.

So I refactored LdapOverlay and added these features. You can download it from
[here]. Just set the `$LdapTLS` variable in your `RT_SiteConfig` module to a
true value to use TLS (but be sure that you also have [Net::SSLeay] installed!).
If you want to allow only members of a certain LDAP group to authenticate to RT,
set the DN of the group in the `$LdapGroup` variable, and set the name of the
member attribute (usually “uniqueMember”) in the `$LdapGroupAttribute` variable.

Enjoy!
