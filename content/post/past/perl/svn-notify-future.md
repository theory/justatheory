This week, I imported [pgTAP] into [GitHub]. It took me a day or so to wrap my
brain around how it's all supposed to work, with generous help [from Tekkub].
But I'm starting to get the hang of it, and I like it. By the end of the day, I
had sent push requests to [Test::More] and [Blosxom Plugins]. I'm well on my way
to being hooked.

One of the things I want, however, is [SVN::Notify]-type commit emails. I know
that there are feeds, but they don't have diffs, and for however much I like
using NetNewsWire to feed by political news addiction, it never worked for me
for commit activity. And besides, why download the whole damn thing again, diffs
and all (assuming that ever happens), for every refresh. Seems like a hell of a
lot unnecessary network activityâ€”not to mention actual CPU cycles.

So I would need a decent notification application. I happen to have one. I
originally wrote SVN::Notify after I had already written [activitymail], which
sends noticies for CVS commits. SVN::Notify has changed a lot over the years,
and now it's looking a bit daunting to consider porting it to Git.

However, just to start thinking about it, SVN::Notify really does several
different things:

-   Fetches relevant information about a Subversion event.
-   Parses that information for a number of different outputs.
-   Writes the event information into one or more outputs (currently plain text
    or XHTML).
-   Constructs an email message from the outputs
-   Sends the email message via a specified method (`sendmail` or SMTP).

For the initial implementation of SVN::Notify, this made a lot of sense, because
it was doing something fairly simple. It was designed to be extensible by
subclassing (successfully done by [SVN::Notify::Config] and
[SVN::Notify::Mirror]), and, later, by [output filters], and that was about it.

But as I think about moving stuff to Git, and consider the weaknesses of
extensibility by subclassing (it's just not pretty), I'm naturally rethinking
this architecture. I wouldn't want to have to do it all over again should some
future SCM system come along in the future. So, following from a private
exchange with [Martijn Van Beers], I have some preliminary thoughts on how a
hypothetical SCM::Notify (VCS::Notify?) module might be constructed:

-   A single interface for fetching SCM activity information. There could be any
    number of implementations, just as long as they all provided the same
    interface. There would be a class for fetching information from Subversion,
    one for Git, one for CVS, etc.
-   A single interface for writing a report for a given transaction. Again,
    there could be any number of implementations, but all would have the same
    interface: taking an SCM module and writing output to a file handle.
-   A single interface for doing something with one or more outputs. Again, they
    can do things as varied as simply writing files to disk, appending to a
    feed, inserting into a database, or, of course, sending an email.
-   The core module would process command-line arguments to determine what SCM
    is being used any necessary contextual information and just pass it on to
    the appropriate classes.

In psedudo-code, what I'm thinking is something like this:

    package SCM::Notify;

    sub run {
        my $args = shift->getopt;
        my $scm  = SCM::Interface->new(
            scm      => $args->{scm} # e.g., "SVN" or "Git", etc.
            revision => $args->{revision},
            context  => $args->{context} # Might include repository path for SVN.
        );

        my $report = SCM::Report->new(
            method => $opts->{method}, # e.g., SMTP, sendmail, Atom, etc.
            scm    => $scm,
            format => $args->{output}, # text, html, both, etc.
            params => $args->{params}, # to, from, subject, etc.
        );

        $report->send;
    }

Then a report class just has to create report in the specified format or formats
and do something with them. For example, a Sendmail report would put together a
report as a multipart message with each format in a single part, and then
deliver it via `/sbin/sendmail`, something like this:

    package SCM::Report::Sendmail;

    sub send {
        my $self = shift;
        my $fh = $self->fh;
        for my $format ( $self->formats ) {
            print $fh SCM::Format->new(
                format => $format,
                scm    => $self->scm,
            );
        }

        $self->deliver;
    }

So those are my rather preliminary thoughts. I think it'd actually be pretty
easy to port the logic of this stuff over from SVN::Notify; what needs some more
thought is what the command-line interface might look like and how options are
passed to the various classes, since the Sendmail report class will require
different parameters than the SMTP report class or the Atom report class. But
once that's worked out in a way that can be handled neutrally, we'll have a much
more extensible implementation that will be easy to add on to going forward.

Any suggestions for passing different parameters to different classes in a
single interface? Everything needs to be able to be handled via command-line
options and not be ugly or difficult to use.

So, you wanna work on this? :-)
