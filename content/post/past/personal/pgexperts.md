A bit of good news: In addition to my ongoing [Kineticode] work doing Bricolage
consulting services, training, and support, I have a new gig! I, along with
[Josh Berkus], [David Fetter], [Andrew Dunstan], and a [team] of other
PostgreSQL experts, have started a new company: [PostgreSQL Experts, Inc.] I'm
really excited about PGX, a cooperative of solid and experienced--dare I say
expert?--people dedicated to providing exceptional PostgreSQL professional
services, including consulting, training, and support.

Moreover, we have a solid group of experienced application developers, who are
ready and willing to build your PostgreSQL-backed applications on [Rails],
[Catalyst], [PHP], or whatever environment you prefer. If it's related to
PostgreSQL, it's what we do.

So [get in touch] or meet us at [PGCon][] (we're sponsoring!) or at [OSCON
2009]. I'm really excited about our company, and looking forward to growing it
as PostgreSQL adoption grows.
