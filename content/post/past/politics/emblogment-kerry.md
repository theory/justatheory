Following Lawrence Lessig's [lead], I am pleased to [endorse] [John Kerry] for
President of the United States of America. In fact, like most Oregonians, I've
already voted by mail. Have you?<

I could say a lot of things about why I support Kerry. But what it really all
comes down to is how incredibly well-qualified he is for the job. Looking back
over the last few presidents, I think that he is perhaps the best qualified
since Richard Nixon--and he comes without all of Nixon's problems. Ultimately,
however, I couldn't make the argument better than it has already been made, ad
nauseam. So I'll just point to the endorsements that make the case so powerfully
that I feel that little more needs be said.
