Following up on my [enblogment of Kerry] four years ago, and with a tip of the
hat to [Lawrence Lessig], I am thrilled to endorse [Barack Obama] for President
of the United States of America. I voted last night (gotta love [Oregon vote by
mail]!).

The single best thing you can read for reasons why I endorse Obama is [*The New
Yorker's* endorsement]. But in case you're not an elitist liberal like me,
perhaps the endorsement of one of these other fine sources might help to sway
you:

-   [The Washington *Post*]
-   [The Los Angeles *Times*]
-   [The New York *Daily News*]
-   [The Miami *Herald*]
-   [The San Francisco *Chronicle*]
-   [Former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell]
-   [The Philadelphia *Inquirer*]
-   [The Chicago *Sun-Times*]
-   [The Chicago *Tribune*]
-   [The Atlanta *Journal-Constitution*]
-   [The Denver *Post*]

Personally, I believe that Barack Obama has the steady hand and unflappable
personality to be able with withstand the worst that the next four years will
throw at him. And, should he win, there will be a *lot* of shit to deal with,
from accusations of stealing the election to confrontations with belligerent
foreign heads of state. In the debates he was cool and composed, completely
unfazed by McCain's bellicosity, and that composure will serve him extremely
well as President, both in his role in the bully pulpit and in dealing with
attacks from within and without. I don't agree with him on every detail of his
policies, and I expect to, in some ways, be disappointed. But I'll take
disagreement and disappointment over the sheer abhorrence of the last eight
years any time.

As for McCain, well, I was never a supporter, never even interested in him as a
candidate. He was kind of interesting to people I respected in 2000, but that's
about the best I can say about him. What I find bizarre is the two reactions to
the McCain campaign that seem to be coming from McCain apologists in the
punditry and the press. On the one hand, there are those who think that [McCain
is in some kind of bubble], unaware of how nasty his own campaign has become. On
the other hand, there are those who think that [McCain knows exactly what he's
doing] with the direction of the campaign. All I can say is, regardless of which
of these is true (or some combination therein), is this really the sort of
person you want to lead the United States of America? Someone who is either so
out of touch that he has no idea what his staff is up to, or who is so obsessed
with his immediate goals that he's willing to drag his entire operation to the
most debased of levels? Neither represents leadership qualities. All I can say
is, “No thanks.”

Barack Obama for President. He's the right man for the job at the right time.
