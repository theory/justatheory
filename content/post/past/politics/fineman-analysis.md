My father-in-law, Steven, sent me [this link] to a *Newsweek* column by Howard
Fineman. Like Steven, I thought it very interesting that a conservative
columnist would be basically saying that the election is all but over for Bush,
given the past week's news. But the funny thing is, I didn't know that Fineman
was conservative until I read that column. What gave it away?

It was this snippet:

This seems typical of conservative commentary--it's a very selective description
of Kerry's position. Yes, Kerry says that the war was a mistake, *but now that
we're in it, we need to do it right,* including getting tough on rooting out the
terrorists (who, by the way, only came into the country after the war started).
Kerry has not dismissed the contributions of existing allies, but has pointed
out that, unlike Desert Storm, this coalition is far from evenly divided. As
Edwards repeatedly said during the Veep debate, the US bears 90% of the cost
among the coalition members, both in terms of dollars and in terms of lives.
There is no contradiction in these statements. The contradiction only comes up
if they're used selectively and outside of appropriate contexts.

I am so sick of this hypocrisy! I keep telling people, I *can't wait* to be
disappointed in Kerry's presidency, as I was with Clinton's. I'll take
disappointment over being offended by the President and his apologists any day!
