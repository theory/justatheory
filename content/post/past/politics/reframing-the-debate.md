In light of the election results, I've been reflecting on what needs to happen
next. I started by thinking about how I'd like to reclaim the word “liberal” for
use by the left in general, and Democrats in particular. [Hendrik Hertzberg][]
[said something interesting] about this on [“Fresh Air”] back in July:

Remembering this discussion, I started thinking about how we might reclaim the
word, and this led me to ponder on how the right, starting with Reagan, turned
it into a bad word. How did they do it? Well, they changed it from an adjective
(“the liberal candidate”) to a noun (“he's a liberal”). They managed this by
applying adjectives to the adjective (but not in the adverbial sense), so we got
“card-carrying liberal”, “tax and spend liberal,” and so on. Perhaps, I thought,
we just need to apply different adjectives to it in our day-to-day usage, such
as “freedom-loving liberal.”

But that's not too strong, is it? Perhaps we could instead borrow the right's
idea of recasting a common word with a negative connotation. Maybe we could
start applying adjectives to other adjectives, such as “conservative.”

I started pondering on what it means to be conservative. It used to be that
conservatives had a core set of values that were primarily focused on reducing
the size of government. To do so, they wanted to lower taxes in order force
lower spending on programs. But it was also important to them to keep the budget
balanced. Tax cuts had to come hand-in-hand with reduced spending, because
otherwise budget shortfalls would just pass debt on to our children, who would
then have to pay more taxes. And in the meantime, the size of government would
not actually be reduced.

This changed, as near as I can tell, during the Reagan administration. Here was
a conservative president who, for the first time, cut taxes but *increased*
spending. Spending on defense and weapons research shot way up in order to beat
the Soviet Union in the so-called “arms race.” Whether or not the arms race was
a justifiable policy in our attempt to “win” the “cold war,” when it was
accompanied by tax cuts, it gave rise to a new type of conservative, the *slash
and burn conservative.*

And George W. Bush is the biggest slash and burn conservative of them all. Even
as he slashed taxes on the richest 1% of the population, he burned through the
[$237 billion] budget surplus (projected by the Congressional Budget Office to
accumulate to $5.6 trillion between 2002 and 2011) in near record time, and
added to it the current [$477 billion] budget deficit (expected to accumulate to
$5.2 trillion over the next ten years). Ten trillion dollar is a lot, but a
slash and burn conservative always believes that there's money to burn.

Where did this budget shortfall come from? After all, tax breaks alone won't
lead to a deficit when you have the kind of surplus we were expecting in 2000.
How has President Bush burned through so much cash in such a short time? Well,
it seems that he's a *slash and spend conservative*. He found new programs to
spend the (nonexistent) money on, such as an incredibly expensive war in Iraq.
Indeed, if Bush is the first [“CEO President,”] as he likes to style himself,
then he must be of the Ken Lay Ilk: he's the *Enron president!*

I mentioned some of these ideas to [Nat] yesterday, and before I could get them
out, fully formed, he pointed me to a new book from [George Lakoff] entitled,
[*Don't think of an Elephant*.] Salon has a [good article] describing the book,
and it does seem that Lakoff (whose work, I was amused to realize, I read in
college when I was getting my MA in Anthropology) is arguing the same thing as
I, only with robust tie-in to how people think and process information.

It's all about reframing the debate, to borrow Lakoff's terminology. The right
has been so good at making a [self-contained argument] into a single
catch-phrase--such as “Clear Skies,” “Healthy Trees,” “partial-birth abortion,”
and “death tax”--that makes it easy for people to digest, so that they feel that
they understand an issue just from the turn of phrase. We in the left need to
follow suit, to find the self contained arguments in the clever turn of phrase.
I'm going to do some more thinking on this, to find other ways to reframe the
debate.

For too long, the right has defined the terms of the debate, and as the left has
responded to them, they have lost, because you can't refute them. We need to
reframe the debate by defining the terms and forcing the right to respond to
those terms. The only way this can be done is if we use a few really good ones
for core issues, and get them into widespread use, repeated over and over, for
the next four years. We need a daily [talking points memo] to outline the
discourse and organize the left, to get us all “on message,” so that people get
the message.

Think you're tired of the phrase “flip-flopper”? Get ready to hear more about
our slash and spend president. Ad nauseam.
