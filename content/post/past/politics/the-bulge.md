**HOLY SHIT!**

According to a [story] in [Salon.com], it appears that George W. Bush may well
have been wearing a radio transmitter during the first debate. This would be so
that he could get prompts from someone more knowledgeable (Dick Cheney?).

[Current Electoral Vote Predictor][] (which currently shows Kerry leading 280 to
239!) has confirmed the presence of “the bulge” with [this image], using Red
Hawk image intensification software.

My favorite phrase from the Salon.com article: the “Milli Vanilli president.”
