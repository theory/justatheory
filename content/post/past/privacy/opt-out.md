Mindful of the fact that Ovid has suffered [identity theft,] and [more than once],
at that, and that it's [incredibly easy] for someone to get a credit card in
your name, I was happy to hear from a friend that you can have your name removed
from the pre-approved credit card application database, so to speak. In the
U.S., all you need to do is call +1 (888) 5-OPT-OUT, provide some information
(including your Social Security number--yikes!), and that's it. Given that it
requires your SSN, I wasn't sure about it, but a quick Googling yielded [this
FTC page] legitimizing the number. And it has links to get me off of direct mail
and direct email lists, too. Sweet!

You should [visit the FTC page][this FTC page] right now and get off those
lists, too.
