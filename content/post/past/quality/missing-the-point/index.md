Thanks for all the comments on my [Disposable Computing] post. Alas, I’m
beginning to see why sites like [Daring Fireball] don’t allow comments. Not that
anyone was rude; it’s just that everyone missed the point. Every last one of
you. (Well, except commenter “John”, who pointed out an inaccuracy in my post.)
Here’s what that post was *not* about:

-   How many iPhones I’ve had over the years
-   The economics of owning an iPad vs. owning a Kindle
-   How long any given Apple product lasted (yours or mine)
-   How durable previous generations of Kindles are
-   The inherent value of the iPhone 3GS or iPad 1
-   The difference in quality between E-ink and LCD displays

Here’s what the post was about:

-   Apple products tend to have great build quality and durability
-   Marco Arment’s [$79 Kindle review] used the terms “cheap” and “disposable”
    to describe the Kindle.
-   The last thing I want in my life is cheap and disposable objects
-   I’d rather have objects that are more durable and likely to last
-   So I’d rather have an iPad than a $79 Kindle.

That’s about it. I’ve never used a Kindle device, just the Kindle iOS app. I
don’t know how crappy the new Kindle actually is. Maybe Marco’s wrong, and the
$79 Kindle is actually incredibly well-built and durable and will last for
years. I just know that if it appears to be cheap and non-durable, I don’t want
it. And I think Marco is a pretty reliable source. So I don’t want a $79 Kindle.

Perhaps my analogy of the $79 Kindle to a Dixie cup was a wee bit overwrought.
Sorry about that; it occurred to me as I was writing the piece and I felt that
it captured what I wanted to day. Because, you know, I’d rather drink my coffee
out of a Contigo thermal mug than out of a Starbucks paper cup. Maybe that’s not
fair.

So how about this? The $79 Kindle is a [Starbucks plastic mug]. Not quite
Dixie-cup disposable, and the advertising helps keep the price down.
