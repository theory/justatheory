Well, this is entertaining. It seems that the Gartner Group has decided that
[iPods] are a significant security threat. I think it's great that a company
like that makes its money by telling people that, yes, you *can* copy files
between your PC and your iPod, and that poses a serious security threat.
*Please.*

The problem, of course, is not the iPod. Or digital cameras. Or floppies. Or CD
burners. No, the problem is *people.* I prefer to build a company that *trusts*
its employees. Novel concept, I know. So here's the mantra: iPods aren't
security threats; *employees* are security threats.

Now, I had to think carefully about posting this, because it reminded me,
suddenly, of the old gun nut statement that guns don't kill people, people kill
people. The reason why I'm willing to use it for the iPod and not guns, however,
has to do with design. Guns are designed to kill. It kind of makes the statement
moot. I mean, what would you expect people to do with them? iPods, however, are
not designed to breach security. They're designed to listen to music, to store
files, to copy your calendar, etc. Now, whether an individual person decides to
use the iPod in breach of a company's security protocols is a matter independent
of the iPod's design and intended use.

So the mantra holds: iPods aren't security threats; *employees* are security
threats. But guns, yeah, they're pretty much designed for killing.
