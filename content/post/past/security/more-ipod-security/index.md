Following up on my [screed] against the idea of the “iPod security threat”,
[James Duncan Davidson] sent me a link to [this story] about how the UK
military has decided that the iPod is a security threat.

Huh. Do you mean to tell me that if you plug into the USB port of a PC that no
one is logged in to, you can get access to the contents of the PC without
logging in? You know, that sounds more like a *Windows* security flaw than an
iPod problem. I mean, it's reasonable for the military to ban external media in
order to prevent their personnel and contractors from copying sensitive data
onto personal devices for unknown purposes. But this Windows security hole
seems, well, *huge*.

And the truth is that these articles that single out the iPod as a security
threat are being disingenuous, in that it's much easier and much cheaper to use
a [USB Flash Drive]. Furthermore, this banning of storage devices really only
keeps honest people honest; those who really want to copy sensitive information
to take home will figure out a way to do it if they're motivated enough.

So yeah, highly sensitive security establishments *should* ban personal external
storage devices to keep honest people honest, but really, they should also fix
the real security problem with their operating system of choice.
