Just a quick post to announce that I’ve set up a [Sqitch Google Group]. I’ve
been getting a lot more email about it lately, and a fair bit of it should be
shared more generally. So if you’re interested in Sqitch, sign up! (Don’t like
web forums? Me neither. Feel free to [subscribe by email], instead.)

  [Sqitch Google Group]: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sqitch-users
  [subscribe by email]: mailto:sqitch-users+subscribe@googlegroups.com
