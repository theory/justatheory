Thanks to the hard-working hamsters at the [ActiveState PPM Index], Sqitch is
available for installation on Windows. According to the [Sqitch PPM Build
Status], the latest version is now available for installation. All you have to
do is:

1.  Download and install [ActivePerl]
2.  Open the Command Prompt
3.  Type `ppm install App-Sqitch`

As of this writing, only PostgreSQL is supported, so you will need to [install
PostgreSQL].

But otherwise, that’s it. In fact, this incantation works for any OS that
ActivePerl supports. Here’s where you can find the `sqitch` executable on each:

-   Windows: `C:\perl\site\bin\sqitch.bat`
-   Mac OS X: `~/Library/ActivePerl-5.16/site/bin/sqitch` (Or
    `/usr/local/ActivePerl-5.16/site/bin` if you run `sudo ppm`)
-   Linux: `/opt/ActivePerl-5.16/site/bin/sqitch`
-   Solaris/SPARC ([Business edition]-only):
    `/opt/ActivePerl-5.16/site/bin/sqitch`

This makes it easy to get started with Sqitch on any of those platforms without
having to become a Perl expert. So go for it, and then get started with [the
tutorial]!
