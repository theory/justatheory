I found myself with a little unexpected time at [work] recently, and since we
use Oracle (for a few more months), I decided to port [Sqitch]. Last night, I
released v0.970 with full support for Oracle. I did the development against an
[11.2 VirtualBox VM], though I think it should work on 10g, as well.

Sqitch is available from the usual locations. For Oracle support, you’ll need
the [Instant Client], including SQL\*Plus. Make sure you have [`$ORACLE_HOM`]
set and you’ll be ready to install. Via CPAN, it’s

``` sh
cpan install App::Sqitch DBD::Oracle
```

Via [Homebrew][]:

``` sh
brew tap theory/sqitch
brew install sqitch-oracle
```

Via ActiveState PPM, install [ActivePerl], then run:

``` sh
ppm install App-Sqitch DBD-Oracle
```

There are a few other minor tweaks and fixed in this release; check the [release
notes] for details.

Want more? I will be giving a half-day tutorial, entitled “[Agile Database
Development],” on database development with [Git], [Sqitch], and [pgTAP] at on
May 22 [PGCon 2013] in Ottawa, Ontario. Come on up!
