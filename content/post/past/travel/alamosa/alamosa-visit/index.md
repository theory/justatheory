Last week, I went on a brief business trip for [Kineticode] to Alamosa,
Colorado. The client was [Adams State College], which is planning to use
Bricolage to manage all of its content. Alamosa is a sleepy little town of 8,000
people 22 miles north of the border with New Mexico, situated in the largest
valley in the world, I'm told. You can get any kind of food you want there, as
long as it's Mexican food, and the high altitude (ca. 2300 m) makes the tequila
work wonders on one's equilibrium.

Mostly I just worked with our clients, but I did manage to take a couple of
photos, but I did manage to get a couple of photographs with my [Nokia 6600].
The “cool” coffeehouse in Alamosa is [Milagro's Coffeehouse], but to judge by
their sign, I wasn't sure I wanted what they were selling.

Alamosa has a very small airport. When I flew in on the little prop plane from
Great Lakes Airlines, I was one of two passengers. On the way out (I flew
through Denver), there were five of us. I thought the engine looked cool out my
window, so I turned on my phone (bad David!) and snapped another shot.

Looks like I might be returning to Alamosa soon to do some training. Maybe I'll
be able to get some more pictures; the sunsets are quite lovely there.
