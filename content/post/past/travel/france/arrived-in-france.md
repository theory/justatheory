<p>Well, we made it. Things went pretty smoothly, all told. The flight was fairly empty, so Anna, at least, was able to lie across two seats and get a few hours of sleep. Julie and I enjoyed the free cognac and dark chocolate. Those European airlines sure know how to take care of their passengers.</p>

<p>The Frankfurt layover was uneventful, if a bit on the long side. We did get a bit confused, going to the wrong terminal only to discover that our connecting flight was in the terminal we arrived in. But it was no big deal; good to move around a bit. The novel part for me was customs. Even though we were flying to France, we went through customs in German. Hello EU!</p>

<p>Arriving in Paris, we fetched our bags from baggage claim and headed for the taxi stand. We were approached my some random guy offering us a ride into town in his <q>taxi</q> for €80, and then €50, but I would have none of it. We got a standard tax at the stand allocated for that purpose, and arrived safely at hour hotel 20 minutes later for around €35. Right, you don't just go along with the aggressive dudes who approach you uninvited in the terminal anymore. Yay progress!</p>

<p>At the hotel, Julie and Anna napped for a bit (it was mid-afternoon, and I wouldn't let them have more than an hour), and then we went out for a bite. The <a href="http://www.hotelvaladon.com/" title="Hôtel Valadon Paris — between rue cler market and eiffel tower">hotel</a> is in a great part of town, just a few blocks from le Tour Eiffel in the 7e arrondissemont. We were tired, though, so just hit a local brasserie, where we had pizza and salad and, for Anna, at the suggestion of our server, french fries (yes, the server called them that; must've assumed we were stupid Americans!). Then we walked around a bit and hit the hay by 8 pm.</p>

<p>Next morning, after a nice light breakfast of rolls, croissants, and home-made jelly, we walked over to the Eiffel Tower for a quick look around. The sky was grey and things a bit wet, but we enjoyed it. Anna rode on a nearby carousel. We walked under the tower, currently undergoing some major maintenance, and watched the boats go by on the river for a bit. Then we grabbed a cab back to the hotel, got our stuff, and headed to the train station.</p>

<p>We were nice and early for the TGV, but the train itself was late. The quai was announced only a few minutes before the scheduled departure and then, once on the train, we waited 45 minutes to actually leave. Once we did leave, however, the trip to Rouen took only a bit more than an hour. Anna fell asleep in Julie's lap while I consumed <cite>The New Yorker</cite>.</p>

<p>In Rouen, we took another taxi to our house, only a few minutes away, and were warmly greeted by our hosts. For the next 7 hours, Julie struggled with translations, our hosts speaking nary a word of Anglaise, as a parade of friends and neighbors came to call: The friends of our hosts who are also going to be staying our house in Portland, along with their car, which we're borrowing; the graphic designer tenant in the flat next-door, who dropped by with a bag of fresh-baked breads. The two neighbor girls, aged 4 and 6, along with their mother; the baby-sitter and her parents, and probably other people I'm forgetting. Jean-Paul also gave us a quick driven tour of Rouen, including their plot in the local community garden, where we can go pick fresh carrots, brussels sprouts, cabbage, leeks, beets, and other yummy stuff. The town looks nice, too.</p>

<p>After a lovely dinner, Julie and I headed to bed. Anna awoke a few times in the night, but did pretty well overall. Our hosts left at 6:30, and we got up shortly thereafter to start our first full day in our house in Rouen. After breakfasting on the fresh bread, Neufchâtel cheese, and home-made jelly, we took the loaned umbrella-stroller and hit the streets to get to know our new town a bit. We're up on a hill north of the downtown area, and getting around with the stroller is a bit of a drag, but the town is quite nice, if cold this time of year (that was expected). Over the next few days, we walked to the open-air market downtown and bought some produce and fromage, hit an incredible children's bookstore on Rue Jeanne d'Arc, and, today, le <a href="http://www.rouen-musees.com/index.php?idR=12">Musee des Beaux-Arts</a>. Anna has complained a bit, but has been willing to go along with our exploring plans so far. We'll see how things go in the next few days.</p>

<p>The house we're staying in is pretty nice. It's actually three very narrow flats combined into one moderately-sized house. The first floor has an entry way and bathroom, a media room and dining room, and a kitchen and laundry room (no dryer; we hang our laundry here). The second floor has a den/guest bedroom, a large bathroom, and our host's bedroom. The top floor, which is a converted attic, has three bedrooms: ours, Anna's, and a third room with lots of toys in it (<q>the toy room</q>). The size of the space suits us well.</p>

<p>Jet lag hasn't been near the problem we've expected, although J and I have had trouble staying awake between 2pm and 5pm. Anna has awakened a few times each night, but down to only once last night, around 1:15. Hopefully she'll sleep straight through tonight! I (mostly) skipped the nap yesterday and today, and J didn't nap today, so I'm thinking that tomorrow we should be pretty near fully acclimated to the time zone.</p>

<p>Well this has been pretty boring. For a more interesting description of our travels, see Julie's blog, <a href="http://strongrrl.blogspot.com/">Six Semaines en France</a>. I'll see about blogging here a bit more regularly, too, to try to avoid these long boring posts, though your best luck to learn about our visit to France from me is via my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/theory/">Flicker photostream</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, up next: A visit to Paris Tuesday to Wednesday this week, and planning another visit for December 10th, around a possible visit to the <a href="http://paris.mongueurs.net/" title="Paris Perl Mongueu(r|se)s">Paris Perl Mongers</a>.</p>
