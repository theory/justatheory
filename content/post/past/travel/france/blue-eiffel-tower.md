I finally got around to posting my photos of the [Blue Eiffel Tower] on Flickr.
The Tower is lit in blue in celebration of the French Presidency of the EU, and
will remain blue for another six months or so, from what I understand.
Naturally, it got my attention when we last visited Paris, so I spent about an
hour and a half shoot it from the Champ de Mars and directly underneath it. It
was really quite beautiful, and I especially enjoyed getting some of the details
of the decorative Steel of the tower in blue.

Overall, I’m pretty happy with the results of this shoot. I shot all of the
photos with my 50mm F/1.8 “Nifty Fifty,” just because I wanted the speed and
sharpness that my 28-105mm zoom just can’t deliver. Shooting at F/1.8, I was
able to get about 1/60 shutter speed most of the time, which allowed me to shoot
the whole thing hand-held. But this was at the expense of some detail, I’m sure,
not to mention sharpness. Next time, I’d like to have a tripod and a wide-angle
prime lens. Alas, I’m not likely to acquire them during this visit. But maybe
next time the Eiffel Tower will be red!
