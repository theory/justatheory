We spent seven weeks last summer [in Northern France]. Man it was an awesome
time. None of us wanted to leave! Well, almost true. The thing about Normandy is
that the weather is very much like Portland—except that [Juneuary] lasts through
July and August. We were so desperate for sun that we spent a week [in
Barcelona].

This summer will be different. Much warmer. No, not Portland, but two months in
[Arles], in [Provence]. Yes, we are once again doing a home exchange, this time
in the city in which [Vincent Van Gogh] famously spent his [final years]. Nice,
warm, Mediterranean weather.

We can’t wait.
