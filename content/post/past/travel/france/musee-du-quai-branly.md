I’ve just [posted] a new set of photos from our trip to France. This time I’ve
put up photos of le [Musée du quai Branly], a fabulous example of modern
architecure together with ecologically-inspired landscaping that opened next to
the Eiffel Tower in 2006. Anna and I walked around outside as we made our way
back to our hotel one afternoon; maybe next time we’ll go inside!

Last week, I posted [some photos] from Rouen featuring [Saint Ouen] and le
[Eglise Jean d’Arc]. It was a foggy day, but that added to the mood.

I’m down to just 10 sets from France that need processing and posting. At least
I’ve already done a once-over and removed most of the crappy shots. Now it’s
just reviewing, tweaking, and posting. With luck, I’ll have them all posted by
Christmas!
