We overnighted in Paris last week. It was a whirlwind visit but we made the best
of it. I keep thinking I’ll take the time to blog more about our trip, but keep
using my time to process the photos I’ve taken. Honestly, Aperture is still
quite a time suck, even in its 2.0 iteration. I might have to try Lightroom one
of these days.

At any rate, I’ve gone through about a third of the photos from that trip and
have posted them in a [Flickr photo set] Keep visiting that set over the next
few days as I process more of the photos. Then maybe I’ll get to the shots I’ve
made here in Rouen!

In the meantime, for much more active blogging of our trip, be sure to visit
