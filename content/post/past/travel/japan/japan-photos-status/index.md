Much to my amusement, [Twitter] seems to think that I've tweeted over 5,000
times. I don’t see how this can possibly be, but there are days when I tweet a
lot I guess. Still, 5,000 in a little under three years seems excessive. I
realize that it counts DMs and retweets in that number (not many retweets yet,
of course), but still, I question their algorithm. Since one can’t access one’s
entire history of tweets (yet?), I can’t count for myself, either, alas.

In other news, I’ve been slowly making may way through my photos from the family
[trip to Japan]. Yesterday, I posted photos from [Kiyomizu-dera, Gion, and
Teramachi], taken our first day in Kyoto. What a fabulously beautiful place! We
walked around for hours, and it was a photographic feast. It was all I could do
to trim things down to just 63 photos. I have many hundreds more to process
still, from Kyoto, Nara, and Tokyo. I'll get them up over the next week.

As for my current status? I realize I've been blogging less, but I've been no
less busy hacking Perl and PostgreSQL stuff. In addition to ushering out a new
version of [Pod::Simple], I've been updating [the code] for my Perl doc browser
project ([example]), adding features to [pgTAP], and, erm, planning other stuff.
Things will likely be slowish through the holidays, but there should be some
interesting stuff trickling out over the coming weeks. Till then, this status
post will have to do.
