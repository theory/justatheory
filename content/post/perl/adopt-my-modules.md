Dear Perl Community,

Over the last 17 years, I've created, released, updated, and/or maintained a
slew of Perl modules [on CPAN]. Recently my work has changed significantly, and
I no longer have the time to properly care for them all. A few, like
[Pod::Simple] and [Plack::Middleware::MethodOverride] have co-maintainers, but
most don't. They deserve more love than I can currently provide. All, therefore,
are up for adoption.

If you regularly use my modules, use a service that depends on them, or just
like to contribute the community, consider becoming a maintainer! Have a look at
[the list][on CPAN], and if you'd like to rescue an orphan module, hit me up via
[Twitter] or email me at `david` at this domain.
