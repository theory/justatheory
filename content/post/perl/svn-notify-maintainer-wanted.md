I've used Subversion very occasionally [since 2009], and [SVN::Notify] at
all. Over the years, I've fixed minor issues with it now and then, and made
the a couple of releases to address issues fixed by others. But it's past the
point where I feel qualified to maintain it. Hell, the repository for
SVN::Notify has been [hosted on GitHub] ever [since 2011]. I don't have an
instance of Subversion against which to test it; nor do I have any SMTP
servers to throw test messages at.

In short, it's past time I relinquished maintenance of this module to someone
with a vested interest in its continued use. Is that you? Do you need to keep
SVN::Notify running for your projects, and have a few [TUITs] to fix the
occasional bug or security issue? If so, drop me a line (david @ this domain).
I’d be happy to transfer the repository.
