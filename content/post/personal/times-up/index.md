December 22, 2023 was my last day at [The New York Times]. My tenure was just
under two and a half years.

My first 19 months at the company were pretty much everything [I had hoped], as
I collaborated with Design and Product to design a distributed platform and
conceived, designed, and implemented [CipherDoc], a service for encrypted data
management. I'm incredibly proud of that work!

But alas, plans change. After the company mothballed the project, I refocused my
time on [glue work]: re-platforming services, upgrading runtimes and
dependencies, improving logging and observability, and documenting code,
architectures, and playbooks. It felt good to reduce the onboarding,
maintenance, and on-call overhead for my teams; I hope it helps them to be more
productive and fulfilled in their work.

I treasure the terrific people I met at The Times, just super thoughtful,
empathetic, and creative co-workers, partners, and colleagues. It's no wonder
they had the energy to form a union, [The Times Tech Guild], for which I'm
gratified to have helped organize and steward members. The Guild connected me
with a far broader range of talented and committed people than I would have
otherwise. I will miss them all, and continue to cheer for and support the
movement from the outside.

And now, as 2023 winds down, I've decided to try something new. More news
in the new year!
