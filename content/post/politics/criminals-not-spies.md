Masha Gessen, in [a piece] for _The New Yorker_:

> We cringed at the characterization of the Russian online influence campaign as

> --- convincingly portrayed the troll operation as small-time and ridiculous.
> It was, it seems, fraudulent in every way imaginable: it perpetrated fraud on
> American social networks, creating fake accounts and events and spreading

I think this is exactly right. So much of the coverage depicts the Russian
hacking as "vast" and "sophisticated". As a technologist working in information
security, I find this framing irresponsible and naïve at best --- complicit at
worst. (Sadly, even the former director of the CIA [uses this framing].) The
techniques are those used for fraud, extortion, blackmail, and the like. They
effectively advance a criminal conspiracy because they're simple; they exploit
human vulnerabilities. A far cry from clandestine government surveillance or
espionage, the point is disinformation for the benefit of a very few. Painting
it as "massive" or "advanced" only increases its effectiveness.

That's just one aspect of the problematic coverage. Gessen also brings a
sociological perspective to bear: The Russian government and its cohort more
closely approximates a "Mafia state" than a dictatorship. A press that
understands the difference will cover these people not as heads of state, but as
criminals who happen to control states. I hope some, at least, take it to heart.
