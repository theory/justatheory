The New York _Times_ Editorial Board in an [unusually direct piece] last week:

> It is regular citizens [who threaten election officials] and [other public
> servants], who ask, ["When can we use the guns?"] and who [vow to murder]
> politicians who dare to vote their conscience. It is Republican lawmakers
> [scrambling to make it harder] for people to vote and easier to subvert their
> will if they do. It is Donald Trump who [continues to stoke the flames] of
> conflict with his rampant lies and limitless resentments and whose twisted
> version of reality still dominates one of the nationâ€™s two major political
> parties.
>
> In short, the Republic faces an existential threat from a movement that is
> openly contemptuous of democracy and has shown that it is [willing to use
> violence] to achieve its ends. No self-governing society can survive such a
> threat by denying that it exists. Rather, survival depends on looking back and
> forward at the same time.

See also [this _Vox_ piece]. Great to see these outlets sound the alarm about
the dangers to American democracy. The threats are very real, and clear-eyed
discussions should ver much be dominating the public sphere.

More of this, please.
