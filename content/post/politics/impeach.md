Dan Pfeiffer's has [a plan to win the impeachment fight][plan]:

Smart strategy to "prosecute a devastating case against Trump that increases the
likelihood that Democrats win the White House, expand our House Majority, and
take the Senate." Each day brings us closer to impeachment proceedings,
regardless of what Democratic leadership might want. The over-the-top
malfeasance and criminality of this president and his White House leads
inexorably to impeachment proceedings. It's past time for the Democrats to
accept that fact and make a plan to maximize its effectiveness.
