Virginia Heffernan finds that [Donald Trump Has No Values]:

> He has no honor among thieves, no cosa nostra loyalty, no Southern code
> against cheating or lying, none of the openness of New York, rectitude of
> Boston, expressiveness and kindness of California, no evangelical family
> values, no Protestant work ethic. No Catholic moral seriousness, no sense of
> contrition or gratitude. No Jewish moral and intellectual precision, sense of
> history. He doesn’t care about the life of the mind OR the life of the senses.
> He is not mandarin, not committed to inquiry or justice, not hospitable. He is
> not proper. He is not a bon vivant who loves to eat, drink, laugh. There’s
> nothing he would die for --- not American values, obviously, but not the land
> of Russia or his wife or young son.

Read the whole thing --- it's short, and *utterly devastating.* There really is
nothing redeemable about Donald Trump. Not one thing.
