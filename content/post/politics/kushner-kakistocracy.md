The Kushner Kakistocracy

Katherine Eban, in a [deeply reported piece][jkfail], for *Vanity Faire*:

> Those representing the private sector expected to learn about a sweeping
> government plan to procure supplies and direct them to the places they were
> needed most. New York, home to more than a third of the nation’s coronavirus
> cases, seemed like an obvious candidate. In turn they came armed with specific
> commitments of support, a memo on the merits of the Defense Production Act, a
> document outlining impediments to the private-sector response, and two key
> questions: How could they best help? And how could they best support the
> government’s strategy?
> 
> According to one attendee, Kushner then began to rail against the governor:
> “Cuomo didn’t pound the phones hard enough to get PPE for his state…. His
> people are going to suffer and that’s their problem.”

But wait, it gets worse:

> Kushner, seated at the head of the conference table, in a chair taller than
> all the others, was quick to strike a confrontational tone. “The federal
> government is not going to lead this response,” he announced. “It’s up to the
> states to figure out what they want to do.”
> 
> One attendee explained to Kushner that due to the finite supply of PPE,
> Americans were bidding against each other and driving prices up. To solve
> that, businesses eager to help were looking to the federal government for
> leadership and direction.
> 
> “Free markets will solve this,” Kushner said dismissively. “That is not the
> role of government.”

Seldom have falser words been spoken. These incompetents conflate their failure
to lead with their belief that the government cannot lead. The prophecy fulfills
itself.

> The same attendee explained that although he believed in open markets, he
> feared that the system was breaking. As evidence, he pointed to a CNN report
> about New York governor **Andrew Cuomo** and his desperate call for supplies.
> 
> “That’s the CNN bullshit,” Kushner snapped. “They lie.”
> 
> “That’s when I was like, We’re screwed,” the shocked attendee told *Vanity
> Fair.*

And indeed we sure have been. Nearly [200,000 have died] from Covid-19 in the
United States to date, with close to 400,000 deaths [forecast by January 1].

I'm restraining myself from quoting more; the reporting is impeccable, and the
truth of the situation deeply alarming. Read [the whole thing][jkfail], then
maybe go for a long walk and practice deep breathing.

And then [Vote]. And make sure everyone you know is registered and ready to
vote.
