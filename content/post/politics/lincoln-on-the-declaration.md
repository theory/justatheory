Abraham Lincoln, [interpreting] the [Declaration of Independence], in 1858:

> We hold these truths to be self evident: that all men are created equal; that
> they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among
> these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."
>
> This was their majestic interpretation of the economy of the Universe. This
> was their lofty, and wise, and noble understanding of the justice of the
> Creator to His creatures.
>
> Yes, gentlemen, to *all* His creatures, to the whole great family of man. In
> their enlightened belief, nothing stamped with the Divine image and likeness
> was sent into the world to be trodden on, and degraded, and imbruted by its
> fellows.
>
> They grasped not only the whole race of man then living, but they reached
> forward and seized upon the farthest posterity. They erected a beacon to guide
> their children and their children's children, and the countless myriads who
> should inhabit the earth in other ages. Wise statesmen as they were, they knew
> the tendency of prosperity to breed tyrants, and so they established these
> great self-evident truths, that when in the distant future some man, some
> faction, some interest, should set up the doctrine that none but rich men, or
> none but white men, were entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of
> happiness, their posterity might look up again to the Declaration of
> Independence and take courage to renew the battle which their fathers
> began---so that truth, and justice, and mercy, and all the humane and
> Christian virtues might not be extinguished from the land; so that no man
> would hereafter dare to limit and circumscribe the great principles on which
> the temple of liberty was being built.
