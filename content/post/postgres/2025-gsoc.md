I'm pleased to welcome [Mankirat Singh][blog] to the Postgres community as a
2025 [Google Summer of Code] contributor. Mankirat will be developing an ABI
compliance checker and reporting system to help identify and prevent
unintentional ABI changes in future minor Postgres releases. This follows on
the heels of the addition of [ABI and API guidance] in Postgres 18, as well as
the [ABI-breaking Postgres 17.1 release]. What timing!

Please follow Mankirat's [blog] as he develops the project this summer, under
the mentorship of myself and [Pavlo Golub]. It should also soon be on [Planet
PostgreSQL]. We've also set up the `#gsoc2025-abi-compliance-checker` channel
on the [community Slack] for ad-hoc discussion. Join us!
