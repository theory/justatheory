This week, my fellow Tembonaut [Ian Stanton] will present the [extension
ecosystem mini-summit][mini-summit] talk, "Building Trunk: A Postgres Extension
Registry and CLI". We felt it important to get some insight from a couple of the
recently Postgres extension registries: what problems they set out to solve, how
the were built and operate, their success at addressing their issues, and what
issues remain, both for the projects and th ecosystem overall. Ian plans to give
us the low-down on [trunk]. 

[Join us][mini-summit]! Need other information or just want an invitation
 without using Eventbrite, hit me up at `david@` this domain, [on Mastodon], or
