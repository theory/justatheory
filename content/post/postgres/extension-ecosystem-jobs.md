  The challenges of the current Postgres extension ecosystem and the
  interest and energy put into exploring new solutions make clear that the
  time has come to revisit the whole idea. We begin with a survey of the
  jobs to be done by extensions packaging and distribution.

Over [on the Tembo blog] I've published a thinking-through of what all the
[jobs to be done] of the ideal Postgres extension ecosystem might be:

> These challenges and the interest and energy put into exploring new solutions
> make clear that the time has come to revisit the whole idea of the PostgreSQL
> extension ecosystem: to work though the jobs to be done, specify the tools to
> do those jobs, and outline a plan for the broader Postgres community to design
> and build them.
>
> Future posts will dream up the tools and make the plan; today we begin with
> the jobs.
>
> ðŸŽ¬ Letâ€™s get started.
