I'm pleased to announce that some pals and I have organized and will host the
(first annual?) [Extension Ecosystem Summit] at [PGConf.dev] in Vancouver (and
more, see below) on May 28:

> Enabling comprehensive indexing, discovery, and binary distribution.
>
> Participants will collaborate to examine the ongoing work on PostgreSQL
> extension distribution, examine its challenges, identify questions, propose
> solutions, and agree on directions for execution.

Going to PGConf? Select it as an "Additional Option" when you [register], or
[update your registration][register] if you've already registered. Hope to see
you there!

## Extension Ecosystem Mini-Summit

But if you can't make it, that's okay, because in the lead up to the Summit, to
we're hosting a series of six virtual gatherings, the [Postgres Extension
Ecosystem Mini-Summit][mini-event].

Join us for an hour or so every other Wednesday starting March 6 to hear
contributors to a variety of community and commercial extension initiatives
outline the problems they want to solve, their attempts to so, challenges
discovered along the way, and dreams for an ideal extension ecosystem in the
future. Tentative speaker lineup:

*   March 6: [David Wheeler], PGXN: "State of the Extension Ecosystem”
*   March 20: [Ian Stanton], Tembo: "Building Trunk: A Postgres Extension Registry and CLI"
*   April 3: [Devrim Gündüz]: "yum.postgresql.org and the challenges RPMifying
    extensions"
*   April 17: [Jonathan Katz]: "TLE Vision and Specifics"
*   May 1: [Yurii Rashkovskii], Omnigres: "Universally buildable extensions: dev
    to prod"
*   May 15: [David Wheeler], PGXN: "Community Organizing Summit Topics"

Hit the [event page][mini-event] for details. Many thanks to my co-organizers 
[Jeremy Schneider], [David Christensen], [Keith Fiske], and [Devrim Gündüz], 
as well as the [PGConf.dev organizers] for making this all happen!
