Last week I appeared on [s02e03] of the [Hacking Postgres] podcast.

I quite enjoyed this wide-ranging discussion. We covered my history with the
Postgres community, a bunch of the projects I've worked on over the years,
plans and hopes for the [PGXN v2] project, perspectives on people and
technology, and exciting new and anticipated features of Postgres. Find it
