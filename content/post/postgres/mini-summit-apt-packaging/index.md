This Wednesday, April 9 at noon America/New_York (16:00 UTC) for [Extension
Mini Summit #3], where [Christoph Berg] will take us on a tour of the
[PostgreSQL Global Development Group's APT repository][apt] with a focus on
packaging extensions. For those of us foolish enough to consider building our
own binary packaging systems for extensions, this will be an essential
session. For everyone else, come be amazed by the sheer volume of extensions
readily available from the repository. Browse on over to the [Meetup] to
register for this live video conference.
