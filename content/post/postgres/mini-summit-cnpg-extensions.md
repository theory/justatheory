The last Extension Ecosystem Mini-Summit is upon us. How did that happen?

Join us for a virtual conference session featuring [Gabriele Bartolini], who
will be discussing [Extension Management in CNPG]. I'm psyched for this one,
as the PostgresSQL community has contributed quite a lot to improving
extensions management in [CloudNativePG] in the past year, some of which we
covered in [previously]. If you miss it, the video, slides, and transcript
will appear here soon.

Though it may be a week or two to get the transcripts done, considering that
[PGConf.dev] is next week, and featuring the [Extension Ecosystem Summit] on
Tuesday, 13 May in Montreál, CA. Hope to see you there; be sure to say "hi!"
