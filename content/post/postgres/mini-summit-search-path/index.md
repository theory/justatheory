This Wednesday, March 26 at noon America/New_York (16:00 UTC), [Peter
Eisentraut] has graciously agreed to give a talk at the [Extension Mini Summit
#2] on the [extension search path patch] he recently committed to PostgreSQL.
I'm personally stoked for this topic, as freeing extensions from the legacy of
a single directory opens up a number of new patterns for packaging,
installation, and testing extensions. Hit the [Meetup] to register for this
live video conference, and to brainstorm novel uses for this new feature,
expected to debut in PostgreSQL 18.
