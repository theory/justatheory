description: Results of the Postgres community poll for building PGXN v2 in Go, Rust, or both.

Back on March 28, I [asked] the Postgres community whether new services for
[PGXN v2][project] should be written in [Go], [Rust], or "some of each". I
went so far as to create a [poll], which ran through April 12. A month later
you might reasonably be wondering what became of it. Has David been refusing
to face reality and accept the results?

The answer is "no". Or at least I don't think so. Who among us really knows
ourselves. Since it closed, the [poll] has provided the results since it
closed, but I suspect few have looked. So here they are:

| Candidate          | Votes | % All Votes |
|:-------------------|------:|------------:|
| ü¶Ä Rust	         |   102 |       60.4% |
| üêøÔ∏è Go               |    53 |       31.4% |
| üêøÔ∏è + ü¶Ä Some of each |    13 |        7.7% |

**ü¶Ä Rust is the clear winner.**

I don't know whether some Rust brigade descended upon the poll, but the truth
is that the outcome was blindingly apparent within a day of posting the poll.
So much so that I decided to get ahead of things and try writing a [pgrx]
extension. I released [jsonschema] on PGXN on April 30. Turned out to be kind
of fun, and the pgrx developers kindly answered all my questions and even made
a new release to simplify integration testing, now included in the
[`pgrx-build-test`] utility in the [pgxn-tools] Docker image.

But I digress. As a result of this poll and chatting with various holders of
stakes at [work] and haunting the [#extensions] Slack channel, I plan to use
Rust for all new PGXN projects --- unless there is an overwhelmingly
compelling reason to use something else for a specific use case.

Want to help? Rustaceans welcome! Check out the [project plan][project]
plan or join us in the [#extensions] channel on the [Postgres Slack].
