**Update:** 2024-03-06: Slides and video linked below.

A quick reminder that I'll be giving a brief talk on the "State of the Extension
Ecosystem" on Wednesday at noon US Eastern / 17:00 UTC. This talk is the first
in a series of [community talks and discussions][mini-summit] on the postgres
extension ecosystem leading up to the [Extension Ecosystem Summit][the summit]
at pgconf.dev on May 28.

I plan to give a brief history of Postgres extension tools and distribution,
the challenges encountered, recent developments, and opportunities for the
future. It should take about 30 minutes, followed by discussion. Following
this pattern for all the talks in [the series][mini-summit],  I hope to set up
some engaging discussions and to surface significant topics ahead of [the
summit].

 [Join us][mini-summit]! Need other information or just want an invitation
 without using Eventbrite, hit me up at `david@` this domain, [on Mastodon], or
via the [#extensions] channel on the [Postgres Slack].

**Update:** 2024-03-06: Great turnout and discussion, thank you! Links:
