Coming up this week: the fourth installment of the Postgres [extension
ecosystem mini-summit][mini-summit]. The topic: [Trusted Language
Extensions][TLE], a.k.a. [TLE]s. [Jonathan Katz] of [AWS] will give a brief
presentation on "TLE Vision and Specifics" followed by community discussion of
the issues TLEs aim to address, what works and what doesn't, and the role of
TLEs in the future of the extension ecosystem.

[Join us][mini-summit]! **Note!** that if you reserved a spot at a prior
mini-summit, sadly you will need to do so again for each subsequent summit or
miss out on reminders from Eventbrite. And if Eventbrite says the event is
sold out, rest assured we have plenty more virtual seats! Just send at
`david@` this domain, ping me [on Mastodon] or via the [#extensions] channel
on the [Postgres Slack] or the [Postgres Discord].
