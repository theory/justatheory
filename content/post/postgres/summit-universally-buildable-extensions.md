Well that snuck up on me. Tomorrow, May 1 2024, [Yurii Rashkovskii] of
Omnigres will be giving a presentation at the fifth installment of the
Postgres [extension ecosystem mini-summit][mini-summit]. The tal, "Universally
buildable extensions: dev to prod", should provoke some interesting
asymmetrical thinking and discussion. I hope to see you [there][mini-summit].

**Note!** If you reserved a spot at a prior mini-summit, you will need to do
so again for each subsequent event or get no reminders from Eventbrite. If
it's sold out just email `david@` this domain, ping me [on Mastodon] or via
the [#extensions] channel on the [Postgres Slack] or the [Postgres Discord]
for a link or, if you'd like a calendar invitation.
