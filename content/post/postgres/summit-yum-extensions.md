Quick reminder that [Devrim Gündüz] of [EnterpriseDB] will be giving a talk at
this week's [extension ecosystem mini-summit][mini-summit], an overview of the
[PostgreSQL Yum Repository][Yum] architecture, how new RPMs are added, and
issues and challenges with distributing RPMed extensions.

The community [Yum] and [Apt] repositories are the canonical distributors of
PostgreSQL community builds on Linux platforms, with a long history of robust
support for multiple OSes, OS versions, and PostgreSQL versions. Devrim will
help us understand how the Yum repository works, the inclusion of extensions
from the broader community, and the challenges for automatic binary packaging
for all publicly-available extensions.

[Join us][mini-summit]! **Note!** that if you reserved a spot at a prior
mini-summit, sadly you will need to do so again for each subsequent summit or
miss out on reminders from Eventbrite.

Need other information or just want an invitation without using Eventbrite,
hit me up at `david@` this domain, [on Mastodon], or via the [#extensions]
channel on the [Postgres Slack].
