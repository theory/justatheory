  title: Helen Nissenbaum on Data Privacy and Consent
---

Cornell Tech Professor of Information Science [Helen Nissenbaum], in [an
interview] for the *Harvard Business Review:*

> The farce of consent as currently deployed is probably doing more harm as it
> gives the misimpression of meaningful control that we are guiltily ceding
> because we are too ignorant to do otherwise and are impatient for, or need,
> the proffered service. There is a strong sense that consent is still
> fundamental to respecting people’s privacy. In some cases, yes, consent is
> essential. But what we have today is not really consent.

Well this is some essential reading for data privacy folx. Read the whole thing.

I myself have put too much emphasis on consent when thinking about and working
on privacy issues. The truth is we need to think much deeper about the context
in which consent is requested, the information we're sharing, what it will be
used for, and --- as Nissenbaum describes in this piece --- the impacts on
individuals, society, and institutions. Adding [her book] to my reading list.
