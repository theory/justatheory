Nice application of a `Makefile` to eliminate boilerplate. A couple of notes,
though:

Nice post. A couple comments and questions:

*   As of Sqitch v0.990, you can pass the `--open-editor` option to the `add`
    command to have the new files opened in your editor.

*   If you want to add a pgTAP test with a new change, see [this post].

*   What is the call to `sqitch status` for? Since its output just goes to
    `/dev/null`, I don't understand the point.

*   Also as of v0.990, you can [specify Sqitch targets]. The `-d`, `-u`, and
    other options then override values in the target URI.

*   I *really* want to get Sqitch to [better understand and work with VCSs]. An
    example would be to have it automatically `git add` files created by `sqitch
    add`. Another might be a Git config setting pointing to the Sqitch config
    file. Alas, I don't know when I will have the tuits to work on that.

Lots of room for growth and improvement in Sqitch going forward. You post
provides more food for thought.
