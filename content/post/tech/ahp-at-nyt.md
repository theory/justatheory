Me, [writing for NYT Open]:

> The Identity Team at the Times, responsible for building and maintaining
> identity and authentication services for all of our users, has embarked on an
> ambitious project to build a centralized identity platform. We're going to
> make a lot of decisions, such as what languages we should use, what database,
> how we can best protect personal information, what the API should look like,
> and *so* much more. Just thinking about the discussions and consensus-building
> required for a project of this scope daunts even the most experienced
> decision-makers among us. Fortuitously, a presentation at [StaffPlus NYC] by

> collective decision-making, the Analytic Hierarchy Process ([AHP]).

I quite enjoyed our experiment with AHP, a super useful tool for collective
decision-making. For a less technical primer, Wikipedia has some great examples:

*   [Choosing a leader for an organization]
*   [Buying a family car]
