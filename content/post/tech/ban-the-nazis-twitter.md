Joseph Cox and Jason Koebler, in a [Motherboard article] provoked by a report
that a Twitter employee explained that an automated banning of white supremacy
would also ban Republican politicians:

> Twitter has not publicly explained why it has been able to so successfully
> eradicate ISIS while it continues to struggle with white nationalism. As a
> company, Twitter won’t say that it can’t treat white supremacy in the same way
> as it treated ISIS. But external experts Motherboard spoke to said that the
> measures taken against ISIS were so extreme that, if applied to white
> supremacy, there would certainly be backlash, because algorithms would
> obviously flag content that has been tweeted by prominent Republicans—or, at
> the very least, their supporters. So it’s no surprise, then, that employees at
> the company have realized that as well.

Here’s an idea: ban white supremacists. Then when white supremacists complain,
no matter what their office or political affiliation, cite the tweets at issue
and explain how they violate the rules and qualify has hate speech. If they
scream "free speech!", invite them to find another platform on which to express
their hate.

In other words, do the right thing, and have a fucking backbone.
