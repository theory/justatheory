  I finally deleted all my Twitter accounts, notably @theory. If you see that
  username, it's not me.

I quit Twitter in November 2022, when it became clear that Phony Stark would
take control of the company. No regrets; I've been active [on Mastodon] since
then, via [Ivory], where I've enjoyed the *Twitter ca. 2010* vibe.

But I hadn't deleted my Tweets or my accounts until this week. The change was
finally triggered by the [latest announcement]:

> On Friday, X will adopt a new terms of service policy that for the first
> time explicitly says all users agree to let their posts be used to train
> artificial intelligence, like the company’s generative AI service, Grok.
> Currently, X users can go to the site’s settings and opt out.

I have no interest in feeding Grok or any other large language model. So this
week I deleted all my tweets and then my accounts. I tried to transfer my
personal username to a new, empty account, but in the second between changing
it and switching to another tab to take it, it was somehow acquired by an
account created in 2011 with no posts. Not sure how that worked. Pretty scummy.

So, just to be clear, anyone using these usernames on Twitter are **not me**
anymore:

* @theory
* @lunar_theory
* @DesignScene
* @pgxn

See you [on Mastodon] --- or perhaps [Bluesky].
