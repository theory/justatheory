Just thought I'd pop a quick note here to announce that I've released
activitymail 1.18, now wending its way to a [CPAN] mirror near you. This release
of the CVS activity notification program fixes a bug introduced in 1.16 that
prevented activitymail from properly handling file names with spaces. I've also
added a To Do section for some of the things I'd like to change going forward.
Patches welcome!
