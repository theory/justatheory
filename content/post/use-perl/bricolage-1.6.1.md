I'm pleased to announce announce the release of Bricolage-Devel 1.6.1. This
maintenance release addresses a number of issues in version 1.6.0. Some of the
more important changes since 1.6.0 include:

*   Bricolage now works with HTML::Mason 1.20 and later.

*   Added Chinese (Traditional) localization.

*   `make clone` has been fixed and improved.

*   The Media Type manager works again.

*   Various localization improvements and fixes.

*   "Image", "Audio", and "Video" documents now properly show up on
    desks.

*   Fixed alerts so that alerts are once again sent to the members of
    groups and deleted alerts no longer appear in the UI.

*   The virtual FTP server no longer displays templates in
    subcategories of the current subcategory directory.

*   Fixed Element profile so that Output Channel associations can be
    deleted and deleted fields no longer appear in the UI.

For a complete list of the changes, see the [changes file].
