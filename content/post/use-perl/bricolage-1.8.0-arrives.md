title: Bricolage 1.8.0 Arrives!
---

It is with great pleasure that the Bricolage development team announces
the release of Bricolage 1.8.0. The culmination of over 15 months in
development, with contributions from over 20 independent developers,
and new features sponsored by numerous organizations world-wide,
version 1.8.0 represents a significant new pinnacle for the much-lauded
open-source content management and publishing system. This release
offers more new features, improvements, and performance gains than any
previous release. There are so many, in fact (over 120), that they
can't effectively be included in this announcement. Here are some of
the highlights:

*   Support for managing multiple sites from a single Bricolage
    installation. Each site has its own categories, templates, document
    types, and workflows, and collaboration across sites is supported
    by document aliasing and shared workflow desks.

*   Significant performance boosts to search queries and URI uniqueness
    validation.

*   Email document distribution, which can be used to email the files
    generated by an output channel to one or more email addresses.

*   A greatly simplified and flexible templating and element API.

*   Template sandboxes to enable template development without
    interfering with production templates.

*   Support for Template Toolkit templates
    (http://www.template-toolkit.org).

*   New "Publish" and "Recall" permissions, for improved workflow
    management.

*   Per-user preferences.

*   Document formatting at publish time, rather than publish scheduling
    time.

*   New German and Mandarin localizations.

*   Image thumbnails and icons for all media documents.

*   Support for HTMLArea WYSIWYG editing with HTMLArea. See [http://www.interactivetools.com/products/htmlarea/].
