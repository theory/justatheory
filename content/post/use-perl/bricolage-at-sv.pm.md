Just wanted to post a quick note to let everyone know that I'll be
doing a presentation on Bricolage for the [Silicon Valley Perl Mongers]
this Tuesday, 5 November 2002, at 7 pm. I'll be explaining what
Bricolage is all about, why it's so cool, and doing a demo of document
design and template development. Come check it out. Interested? Grab
the [directions] and
come on out!
