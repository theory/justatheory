title: Bricolage at the Forge
---

* "Toolbox at the Forge" columnist Reuven Lerner has published the
first in a series of articles about Bricolage. This is a good,
technically-oriented article that gets into the guts of Bricolage's
data model and really shows off what a great database PostgreSQL is,
too. So [go read it!]
