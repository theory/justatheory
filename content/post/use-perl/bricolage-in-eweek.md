title: Bricolage in eWeek

To my utter amazement and delight, eWeek, the weekly IT newspaper from
ZD, has posted a [review of Bricolage]!
I had never heard from them, or even noticed that they were interested,
but am delighted with the review. It could not be *more glowing.*
Here's an excerpt:

> However, an open-source content management system called Bricolage 
> bucks this trend, providing an open option that isn't just capable 
> but is one of the best content management systems eWeek Labs has 
> seen, even eclipsing some of the best-known commercial products. 

I'm hoping that this has ramifications for getting the message out
about Bricolage. I think it's time for me to start thinking seriously
about creating commercial support contracts to sell similar to what [Best
Practical] is doing for RT.
