There's been a fair bit of press coverage of Bricolage lately, which, since it's
all positive, is very satisfying. In addition to [the article] in
*[IT-Director.com]* that I mentioned a week ago, a new article, "[*The Register*
signs up for Bricolage,]" appeared today in -- where else? -- *[The Register]*.
They write:

> More than 30 companies contacted us with a view to pitching. Thanks guys, but
> we have made our CMS decision. Step forward Bricolage. 
> 
> It's powerful, it's flexible, it's a perfect fit for the content we currently
> handle and the kind of content we want to handle in the future. As a bonus,
> Bricolage is open source, which we like. 

An article also appeared in *[Intranet Journal]*, entitled ":[Faster, More
Flexible Bricolage Challenges CM Vendors]" There Michael Pastore observes:

> The acceptance of Linux as a viable OS in the enterprise has opened some doors
> for open-source enterprise applications, and in the Web content management
> space there has been a decent amount of buzz surrounding Bricolage. 

It turns out that Pastore also talked to Jupiter Communications about Bricolage:

> Matthew Berk, senior analyst for site technologies and operations at Jupiter
> Research, said Bricolage is one of the open-source projects that has proved to
> be a black eye for high-end content management vendors. (Jupiter Research is a
> division of Jupitermedia, the publisher of this Web site.) 
>
> "[Bricolage] is one of the first projects to claim that 'Hey, this stuff that
> Vignette said is rocket science, isn't,'" Berk said. According to research
> done by Jupiter, eight out of 10 companies surveyed can meet their content
> management requirements with an open-source system. 

I'm pleased that the big IT analyst firms are paying attention to Bricolage. The
success of Bricolage at well-known enterprises such as [Macworld Magazine],
[MacCentral], [The World Health Organization] and The Reg have caused so many in
the industry to sit up and take notice. It's great for open source, for Perl,
and hopefully for my business, too.

Speaking of Kineticode, I should also point out that we've not launched a series
of [Bricolage support plans]. We hope that these will help to keep steady
revenues coming to Kineticode, as well as to validate Bricolage as a product.
Wish us luck!
