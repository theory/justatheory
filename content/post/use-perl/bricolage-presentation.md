For anyone who might be in the neighborhood, I'll be giving an informal
presentation introducing Bricolage tonight (9 Septbember 2002) to the
Mason Users Bay Area group in San Francisco. Here are the details:

> When: Monday September 9, 7-9pm 
> Where: [Ensenda, Inc.]
> 512 2nd St @ Bryant 
> 4th Floor 
> San Francisco 94107 
>
> Bricolage is a full-featured, enterprise-class content management 
> system written in Perl with a Mason-powered UI. It offers a browser-based 
> interface for ease-of use, a full-fledged templating system built 
> on Mason and HTML::Template, and many other features. It operates 
> in an Apache/mod_perl environment, and uses the PostgreSQL RDBMS 
> for its repository. 
>
> This talk will introduce Bricolage and many of its concepts for 
> defining content structure and building documents. And of course, 
> since this is a Mason group, we'll take a look at the close relationship 
> between the Mason templating system and the elements of content 
> in Bricolage. 

Thanks to Philip Mikal for organizing this meeting!
