title: Bricolage Stands Out
---

IT-Director.com has published an article, [Open Source Content Management
arrives], in which Bricolage is the only content management system mentioned:

> However as these software applications mature and lose their uniqueness, they
> become candidates for the open source movement. In the case of content
> management, a number of open source contenders are emerging but [Bricolage],
> in particular, stands out in terms of capability. 
>
> Bricolage is an actively developed content management system with a
> browser-based interface. It has most of the features you would expect from a
> full-featured content management system, including distributed authoring of
> content, workflow and support for user roles and groups. The product was built
> to run Salon.com. Visiting this site gives a useful and interesting
> demonstration of its capabilities. 

The interesting thing is that if you follow the link for the author, Martin
Langham, you'll see that he works for a company called Bloor Research, and is
working on a Report to be published in December for UKÃÂ£296 (US$467 /
Ã¢âÂ¬438) all about content management. The upshot is that it's great that a
research firm says that 1) Open-source CMS is coming into its own; 2) Bricolage
is the standout in that field; 3) No other open-source CMS is mentioned; and 4)
they're publishing an Content Management report. This makes me think that
Bricolage could fare very well indeed when that report comes out. It would be
interesting to see.

The article was also published in [The Register].
