The July, 2003 American Chamber of Commerce in Japan Journal (ACCJ Journal) as
an article entitled, "[Taming the Avalanche: How to choose the software to
manage your company's information explosion]," by Tony Laszlo. It's a good
article that covers the importance of content management systems, gives special
attention to open-source solutions, and features a minor bit of punditry from
yours truly.

Enjoy!
