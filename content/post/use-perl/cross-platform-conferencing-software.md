title: Cross-Platform Conferencing Software?
---

Suddenly I'm getting a number of requests to do Bricolage demos via conferencing
software. I tried to join a WebEx meeting yesterday, but it didn't like any of
my Mac OS X browsers or the versions of Java they had installed (browser
sniffing == bad!).

I'd like to use Mac OS X software to conference with folks using Windows and
other platforms. I can use my old Windows 98 SE box if necessary, but I'd rather
not. Anyone know what the options are for good cross-platform conferencing, and
what works and what doesn't?

Thanks,

David
