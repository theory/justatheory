In In eWeek's [2002: The Tech Good, Bad and Ugly] year-end round-up, Analyst Jim
Rapoza hailed Bricolage as "Most Impressive":

> When an open-source application developed by a few authors and maintained
> mainly by one guy beats the pants off million-dollar competitors in pretty
> much every way, I'm impressed. The [Bricolage] project provides highly capable
> and extremely customizable Web content management capabilities, suitable for
> running even the biggest and most complex Web sites.

Woo-hoo!!
