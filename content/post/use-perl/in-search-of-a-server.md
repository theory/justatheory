The [Bricolage community] is currently working on the design for a [new
Bricolage site]. The site will of course be managed in Bricolage. But we need a
server!

If you or someone you know would be willing to donate and host a server for us,
with the ability to install Bricolage and manage the Bricolage site, please
contact me forthwith!
