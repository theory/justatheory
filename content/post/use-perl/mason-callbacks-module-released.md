I'm pleased to announce the release of [MasonX::ApacheHandler::WithCallbacks]
0.96. This is a fairly minor release, but adds support for httpd.conf directives
and a new module, MasonX::CallbackTester, to help you write tests for your
callback packages and classes.

Now to finish preparing my YAPC presentation.

Enjoy!
