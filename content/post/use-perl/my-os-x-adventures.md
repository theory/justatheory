title: My OS X Adventures

About two weeks ago, I made the switch from [Linux] to [Mac OS X] on my Titanium
[PowerBook]. Yes, it was quite an adventure. But I'm happy to report that it
went extremely well. I got all of my favorite *nix utilities running, as well as
all the essentials a dedicated Perl/mod_perl/PostgreSQL hacker might want.

That's not to say that it wasn't a lot of work. But even more work was all the
notes I was keeping so that I'd know how to do it again. And since I was taking
all those notes, I figured I might as well do the extra extra work of writing up
a little article detailing what I did and how I did it. The result is now
available as [My Mac OS X Adventures].

Any feedback will be most welcome, as I'd like to keep this page up-to-date!
