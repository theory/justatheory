I'm doing another PerlMongers talk, this time for the Pittsburgh
Mongers. I'll be doing my introduction to Bricolage talk. In the area
on Tuesday, September 2, 2003 at 7 pm? Come for the talk!

See the [announcement] for details. Food will be involved.

Thanks to [Casey West] for putting this together!
