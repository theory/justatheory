I just finished downloading a video of Allison Randall's "Tagmemics" talk. I
think that this will be a popular video download from the collection of TPC
talks, because it actually offers some insight into the way Larry thinks. It
proved to be a very popular presentation, with a packed room, and comments
offered by Larry, Damian, Gloria, Chip, and Eric Raymond. The quality of the
video is good, too, since the lighting was much better than it was for Damian's
talks.

Anyway, I think that Allison is making a great contribution to the community,
because she's communicating to people some of the linguistic ideas that underlie
Larry's design decisions. A lot of us talk about how much more expressive Perl
is, and how it's more syntactically friendly for people to use than most other
programming language (if you speak English, at least), but Allison's example in
this talk really makes it clear. Pretty soon, we'll all be talking about whether
our language feature suggestions are emically or etically driven, and where the
syntax we prefer falls within the Tagmemic matrix.

I think that she might make amateur linguists of us all. Other folks at the talk
were likewise impressed, and suggest that a similar talk be made in a bigger
venue next year. If you agree, let O'Reilly know! Fill out a feedback form if
you're at the conference. I suggested that a similar talk be promoted as a major
presentation next year. Who knows, it might bring others around to our way of
thinking.

The video will go up as soon as we can transfer it to another box (all 9.25 GB
of it) and Nat can convert it to RealMedia or QuickTime format. It'll be on the
perl.org site when it's ready. No doubt it'll be posted to use Perl when it's
ready (along with Damian's two talks and whatever I film tomorrow).
