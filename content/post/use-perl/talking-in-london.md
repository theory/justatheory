I've been meaning to post this for a while. Apologies for the delay.

Next Monday, 14 April 2003, I'll be doing a brief Bricolage presentation for
[London.pm]. I will then be participating in panel session on "Templating
Engines and Processing Content." The other participants will be Andy Wardly of
Template Toolkit fame and Mark Lester, creator of Yahoo!'s internal "Jake"
templating system. We'll retire to the pub to discuss things more for hours
after that (hey, why not, it'll be daytime for me then!). Be sure to [sign up]
in advance if you're planning on coming. Be prepared to hear me trying to
convince Andy to implement a TT burner for Bricolage!

If you can't make it to London, come to [YAPC::NA], instead. I'll be doing a 90
minute session on Bricolage there. Bring lots of questions!
