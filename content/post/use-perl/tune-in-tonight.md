I'll be on the radio show [Online Tonight] with David Lawrence, tonight, in the
11 EST / 8 PST slot. We'll be discussing Bricolage, its history, and content
management in general. This is my first time on the radio, so it should be
interesting. The show is a light, humor-oriented tech talk show, and is, along
with *Online Today*, "the most listened to high-tech-oriented talk show on the
air today," according to CNET Radio.

Be sure to [tune in], and feel free to call in and show your support for
Perl-based applications! Or send IMs to me or to host David Lawrence during the
show.
