I worked a lot over the weekend on the Bricolage section of the upcoming
O'Reilly book on [Mason], and now it's done. I mean, it's a draft. Naturally,
I'll want to go in and edit it again in a few weeks, once I have some distance
from it.

Dave and Ken were kind enough to let me rewrite their section on content
management, since for all intents and purposes Mason-CM appears to be dead, and
Bricolage is quite actively maintained. I appreciate their allowing me to
contribute -- I think this will be good for Mason *and* for Bricolage.

At any rate, after a busy couple of weeks, I'm ready to get back to plugging
bugs in Bricolage and planning its future. I'm a bit behind. If I didn't have to
spend so much time trying to hustle up work, it would help. Anyone want to hire
an experienced Perl hacker and Bricolage developer?
