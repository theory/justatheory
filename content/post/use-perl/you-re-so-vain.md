I'd just like to announce that I finally have a [personal web page] up. It has
been years since I took down my "Hotlinks 1995!" page at U.Va., and the time
finally arrived for me to have my own site again. Comments on the content and
layout are most welcome.

Later, I'll post a rant on how I exploited use Perl; for my own nefarious
purposes.
