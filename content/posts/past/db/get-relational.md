<blockquote cite="http://www.oreillynet.com/lpt/a/6060"><p>The idea that the relational model could handle only rather simple kinds of data (like numbers, and strings, and dates, and times) is a huge misconception, and always was. In fact, the term object/relational, as such, is just a piece of marketing hype ... As far as I'm concerned, an object/relational system done right would simply be a relational system done right, nothing more and nothing less.</p></blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.oreillynet.com/lpt/a/6060"><p>So I think it's incumbent on people not to say <q>Tell me the business value of implementing the relational model.</q> I think they should explain what the business value is of not implementing it. Those who ask <q>What's the value of the relational model?</q> are basically saying <q>What's the value of theory?</q> And I want them to tell me what the value is of not abiding by the theory.</p></blockquote>
