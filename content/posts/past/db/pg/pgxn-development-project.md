<p>I'm pleased to announce the launch of the <a href="http://pgxn.org/" title="PostgreSQL Extension Network">PGXN</a> development project. I've written a <a href="http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PGXN" title="PGXN Specification">detailed specification</a> and pushed it through general approval <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/pgsql-hackers@postgresql.org/msg143645.html" title="pgsql-hackers archive: RFC: PostgreSQL Add-On Network">on pgsql-hackers</a>. I've written up a detailed <a href="http://pgxn.org/status.html" title="PGXN Project Status">project plan</a> and estimated things at a highly reduced <a href="http://www.pgexperts.com/">PostgreSQL Experts</a> rate to come up with a fundraising goal: $25,000. And now, thanks to <a href="http://pgxn.org/contributors.html" title="PGXN Contributors">founding contributions</a> from <a href="http://www.myyearbook.com">myYearbook.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.pgexperts.com/">PostgreSQL Experts</a>, we have started the fundraising phase of the project.</p>

<p>So what’s this all about? PGXN, the PostgreSQL Extension Network, is modeled on <a href="http://cpan.org">CPAN</a>, the Perl community’s archive of “all things Perl.” PGXN will provide four major pieces of infrastructure to the PostgreSQL community:</p>

<ul>
<li>An upload and distribution infrastructure for extension developers (models: <a href="http://pause.perl.org">PAUSE</a> &amp; <a href="http://cpan.org/">CPAN</a>, <a href="http://openjsan.org/jause/">JAUSE</a>)</li>
<li>A centralized index and API of distribution metadata (models: <a href="http://cpanmetadb.appspot.com/">CPAN Meta DB</a>, <a href="http://cpan.perl.org/modules/02packages.details.txt">02packages.details.txt</a>)</li>
<li>A website for searching extensions and perusing their documentation (models: <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">search.cpan.org</a>, <a href="http://kobesearch.cpan.org/">Kobesearch</a>, <a href="http://openjsan.org/">JSAN</a>)</li>
<li>A command-line client for downloading, testing, and installing extensions (models: <a href="http://cpanmin.us/">cpanminus</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?cpan">CPAN.pm</a>, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?jsan">JSAN Shell</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>I've been wanting to start this project for a long time, but given my need to pay the bills, it didn’t seem like I'd ever be able to find the time for it. Then Josh Berkus suggested that we try to get community interest and raise money for me to have the time to work on it. So I jumped on that, putting in the hours needed to get general approval from the core PostgreSQL developers and to create a reasonable project plan and web site. And thanks to MyYearbook’s and PGX’s backing, I'm really excited about it. I hope to start on it in August.</p>

<p>If you'd like to contribute, first: <strong>Thank You!</strong>. The <a href="http://pgxn.org/" title="PGXN">PGXN site</a> has a Google Checkout widget that makes it easy to make a donation. If you'd rather pay by some other means (checks are great for us!), <a href="mailto:pgxn@pgexpergts.com">drop me a line</a> and we'll work something out. We have a few levels of <a href="http://pgxn.org/contributors.html" title="PGXN Contributors">contribution</a> as well, including permanent linkage on the PGXN site for your organization, as well as the usual t-shirts launch party invitations.</p>
