<p>The talk that I <a href="/computers/databases/postgresql/plpgsql_talk.html"
title="PL/pgSQL Talk for Portland PostgreSQL Users">announced</a> a couple of
days ago went off very well, I think. Rich Shepard, a local PostgreSQL who was
at the meeting, later said on the mail list:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the happy side, my thanks to Selena for organizing the group and
rounding up a half-dozen cats for the first meeting, and to David for the best
presentation at a computer users group meeting I've seen in 20 years. The
topic was very interesting and the presentation itself highly professional and
polished. It's a standard to be met by future presenters for the benefit of us
all.</p>

  <p>—Rich Shepard</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow, praise doesn't get much higher than that. I'm glad the group got a lot
out of the presentation. For the benefit of those who couldn't make it, I've
<a href="/2006/07/plpgsql-talk-slides/learning_plpgsql.pdf"
title="“Learning PL/pgSQL” slides">posted the slides</a> for your enjoyment.
They might be a bit hard to follow at times without my commentary, but you
should be able to fill in the gaps by reading

<p>So start having some fun with PL/pgSQL!</p>
