<p>Following a very good <a href="/computers/programming/perl/catalyst/sql-view-aggregate-magic.html#tb" title="My Catalyst Tutorial: Add Authors to the View—Comments">suggestion from Pedro Melo</a>, I've created a Git repository for this tutorial and put it <a href="http://github.com/theory/catalyst-tutorial" title="Catalyst Tutorial on GitHub">on GitHub</a>. I replayed each step, making each into its own <a href="http://github.com/theory/catalyst-tutorial/commits/master" title="Commit History for Catalyst Tutorial">commit</a>, and tagged the state of the code for each entry:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://github.com/theory/catalyst-tutorial/commits/part-01">Create Catalyst Views with Template::Declare</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/theory/catalyst-tutorial/commits/part-02">Catalyst with DBIx::Connector and Template::Declare</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/theory/catalyst-tutorial/commits/part-03">Create a Template::Declare Wrapper</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/theory/catalyst-tutorial/commits/part-04">My Catalyst Tutorial: Add Authors to the View</a></li>
</ul>


<p>So as I continue to make modifications, I'll keep this repository up-to-date, and tag things as of each blog entry. This will make it easy for you to follow along; you can simply clone <a href="git://github.com/theory/catalyst-tutorial.git">the repository</a> and <code>git pull</code> for each post.</p>

<p>More soon.</p>
