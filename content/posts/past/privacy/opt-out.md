<p>Mindful of the fact that Ovid has suffered <a href="http://publius-ovidius.livejournal.com/111672.html" title="Don't fuck with Ovid -- the long version">identity theft,</a> and <a href="http://publius-ovidius.livejournal.com/180912.html" title="How to (not) protect your credit">more than once</a>, at that, and that it's <a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/citizen/creditcard/application.shtml" title="The Torn-Up Credit Card Application">incredibly easy</a> for someone to get a credit card in your name, I was happy to hear from a friend that you can have your name removed from the pre-approved credit card application database, so to speak. In the U.S., all you need to do is call +1 (888) 5-OPT-OUT, provide some information (including your Social Security number--yikes!), and that's it. Given that it requires your SSN, I wasn't sure about it, but a quick Googling yielded <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/alerts/privprotalrt.htm" title="Privacy: What You Do Know Can Protect You">this FTC page</a> legitimizing the number. And it has links to get me off of direct mail and direct email lists, too. Sweet!</p>

<p>You should <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/alerts/privprotalrt.htm" title="Privacy: What You Do Know Can Protect You">visit the FTC page</a> right now and get off those lists, too.</p>
