<p>Thanks for all the comments on my <a href="/computers/devices/disposable-computing.html">Disposable Computing</a> post. Alas, I’m beginning to see why sites like <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> don’t allow comments. Not that anyone was rude; it’s just that everyone missed the point. Every last one of you. (Well, except commenter “John”, who pointed out an inaccuracy in my post.) Here’s what that post was <em>not</em> about:</p>

<ul>
<li>How many iPhones I’ve had over the years</li>
<li>The economics of owning an iPad vs. owning a Kindle</li>
<li>How long any given Apple product lasted (yours or mine)</li>
<li>How durable previous generations of Kindles are</li>
<li>The inherent value of the iPhone 3GS or iPad 1</li>
<li>The difference in quality between E-ink and LCD displays</li>
</ul>


<p>Here’s what the post was about:</p>

<ul>
<li>Apple products tend to have great build quality and durability</li>
<li>Marco Arment’s <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/10/07/review-79-kindle-with-ads-and-buttons">$79 Kindle review</a> used the terms “cheap” and “disposable” to describe the Kindle.</li>
<li>The last thing I want in my life is cheap and disposable objects</li>
<li>I’d rather have objects that are more durable and likely to last</li>
<li>So I’d rather have an iPad than a $79 Kindle.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s about it. I’ve never used a Kindle device, just the Kindle iOS app. I don’t know how crappy the new Kindle actually is. Maybe Marco’s wrong, and  the $79 Kindle is actually incredibly well-built and durable and will last for years. I just know that if it appears to be cheap and non-durable, I don’t want it. And I think Marco is a pretty reliable source. So I don’t want a $79 Kindle.</p>

<p>Perhaps my analogy of the $79 Kindle to a Dixie cup was a wee bit overwrought. Sorry about that; it occurred to me as I was writing the piece and I felt that it captured what I wanted to day. Because, you know, I’d rather drink my coffee out of a Contigo thermal mug than out of a Starbucks paper cup. Maybe that’s not fair.</p>

<p>So how about this? The $79 Kindle is a <a href="http://www.starbucksstore.com/Starbucks%C2%AE-Lenticular-Tumbler%2C-16-fl-oz/011014926,default,pd.html?start=4&amp;cgid=tumblers-and-travel-mugs">Starbucks plastic mug</a>. Not quite Dixie-cup disposable, and the advertising helps keep the price down.</p>
