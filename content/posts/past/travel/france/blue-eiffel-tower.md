<p>I finally got around to posting my photos of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/theory/sets/72157611621954549/" title="“Blue Eiffel” on Flickr">Blue Eiffel Tower</a> on Flickr. The Tower is lit in blue in celebration of the French Presidency of the EU, and will remain blue for another six months or so, from what I understand. Naturally, it got my attention when we last visited Paris, so I spent about an hour and a half shoot it from the Champ de Mars and directly underneath it. It was really quite beautiful, and I especially enjoyed getting some of the details of the decorative Steel of the tower in blue.</p>

<p>Overall, I’m pretty happy with the results of this shoot. I shot all of the photos with my 50mm F/1.8 “Nifty Fifty,” just because I wanted the speed and sharpness that my 28-105mm zoom just can’t deliver. Shooting at F/1.8, I was able to get about 1/60 shutter speed most of the time, which allowed me to shoot the whole thing hand-held. But this was at the expense of some detail, I’m sure, not to mention sharpness. Next time, I’d like to have a tripod and a wide-angle prime lens. Alas, I’m not likely to acquire them during this visit. But maybe next time the Eiffel Tower will be red!</p>
