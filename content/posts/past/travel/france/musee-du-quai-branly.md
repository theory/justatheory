<p>I’ve just <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/theory/sets/72157615217912698/" title="Musée du quai Branly">posted</a>
a new set of photos from our trip to
France. This time I’ve put up photos of le
<a href="http://www.quaibranly.fr/">Musée du quai Branly</a>, a fabulous example
of modern architecure together with ecologically-inspired landscaping that
opened next to the Eiffel Tower in 2006. Anna and I walked around outside as
we made our way back to our hotel one afternoon; maybe next time we’ll go
inside!</p>

<p>Last week, I posted <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/theory/sets/72157614752983549/" title="Saint Ouen, Eglise Jean d’Arc">some photos</a> from Rouen featuring
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbey_of_Saint-Ouen" title="Wikipedia: “Church of St. Ouen, Rouen”">Saint Ouen</a> and le
<a href="http://www.cathedrale-rouen.net/patrimoine/visites/stejda.htm">Eglise Jean d’Arc</a>. It was a foggy day, but that added to the mood.</p>

<p>I’m down to just 10 sets from France that need processing and posting. At
least I’ve already done a once-over and removed most of the crappy shots. Now
it’s just reviewing, tweaking, and posting. With luck, I’ll have them all posted
by Christmas!</p>
