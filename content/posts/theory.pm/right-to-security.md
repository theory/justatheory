Rich Mogull:

> Don’t be distracted by the technical details. The model of phone, the method
> of encryption, the detailed description of the specific attack technique,
> and even the feasibility are all irrelevant.
> 
> Don’t be distracted by the legal wrangling. By the timing, the courts, or
> the laws in question. Nor by politicians, proposed legislation, Snowden, or
> speeches at think tanks or universities.
> 
> Don’t be distracted by who is involved. Apple, the FBI, dead terrorists, or
> common drug dealers.
> 
> Everything, all of it, boils down to a single question.

> *Do we have a right to security?*
