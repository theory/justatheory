Name

    Test.Builder - Back end for building test libraries

Synopsis

      var Test = new Test.Builder();
    
      function ok (test, description) {
          Test.ok(test, description);
      }

Description

    Test.Builder provides the buildings block upon which to write test
    libraries like Test.Simple and Test.More that can work together. All
    tests are expected to use a plan and to be run in an HTML element with
    its "id" attribute set to "test". See Test.Simple and Test.More for
    details. Users of this class, however, are expected to be folks who
    want to write test functions that interoperate with Test.Simple and
    Test.More.

 Constants

    Test.PLATFORM

      This constant contains a string that defines the platform in which
      the tests are currently running. Possible values are:

      browser

      director

 Construction

    Test.Builder

        var Test = new Test.Builder();

      Returns a Test.Builder object representing the current state of the
      test.

      Since you only run one test per program, there is one and only one
      Test.Builder object. No matter how many times you call new
      Test.Builder(), you'll get the same object. (This is called a
      singleton).

    create

        var Test = Test.Builder.create();

      OK, so there can be more than one Test.Builder object and this is how
      you get it. You might use this instead of new Test.Builder() if
      you're testing a Test.Builder-based module.

    reset

        Test.reset();

      Reinitializes the Test.Builder singleton to its original state.
      Mostly useful for tests run in persistent environments where the same
      test might be run multiple times in the same process.

 Setting up tests

    These methods are for setting up tests and declaring how many there
    are. You usually only want to call one of these methods.

    plan

        Test.plan({ noPlan:  true     });
        Test.plan({ skipAll: reason   });
        Test.plan({ tests:   numTests });

      A convenient way to set up your tests. Call this method and
      Test.Builder will print the appropriate headers and take the
      appropriate actions.

      If you call plan(), don't call any of the other test setup methods.

    expectedTests

          var max = Test.expectedTests();
          Test.expectedTests(max);

      Gets/sets the number of tests we expect this test to run and prints
      out the appropriate headers.

    noPlan

        Test.noPlan();

      Declares that this test will run an indeterminate number tests.

    hasPlan

        var plan = Test.hasPlan();

      Find out whether a plan has been defined. plan is either null (no
      plan has been set) "noPlan" (indeterminate number of tests) or an
      integer (the number of expected tests).

    skipAll

        Test.skipAll();
        Test.skipAll(reason);

      Skips all the tests in the test file, using the given reason.

 Running tests

    These methods actually run the tests. The description argument is
    always optional.

    ok

        Test.ok(test, description);

      Your basic test. Pass if test is true, fail if test is false. Returns
      a boolean indicating passage or failure.

    isEq

        Test.isEq(got, expect, description);

      Tests to see whether got is equivalent to expect.

    isNum

        Test.isNum(got, expect, description);

      Tests to see whether the numeric form of got is equivalent to the
      numeric form of expect as converted by Number().

    isntEq

        Test.isntEq(got, dontExpect, description);

      The opposite of isEq(). Tests to see whether got is not equivalent to
      dontExpect.

    isntNum

        Test.isntNum(got, dontExpect, description);

      The opposite of isNum(). Tests to see whether the numeric form of got
      is not equivalent to the numeric form of dontExpect as converted by
      Number().

    like

        Test.like(got, /regex/, description);
        Test.like(got, 'regex', description);

      Tests to see whether got matches the regular expression in regex. If
      a string is passed for the regex argument, it will be converted to a
      regular expression object for testing. If <got> is not a string, the
      test will fail.

    unlike

        Test.unlike(got, /regex/, description);
        Test.unlike(got, 'regex', description);

      The opposite of unlike(). Tests to see whether got does not match the
      regular expression in regex. If a string is passed for the regex
      argument, it will be converted to a regular expression object for
      testing. If <got> is not a string, the test will pass.

    cmpOK

        Test.cmpOK(got, op, expect, description);

      Performs a comparison of two values, got and expect. Specify any
      binary comparison operator as a string via the op argument. In
      addition to the usual JavaScript operators, cmpOK() also supports the
      Perl-style string comparison operators:

      eq - String equal

      ne - String not equal

      lt - String less than

      gt - String greater than

      le - String less than or equal

      ge - String greater than or equal

    BAILOUT

          Test.BAILOUT(reason);

      Indicates to the Test.Harness that things are going so badly all
      testing should terminate. This includes running any additional test
      files.

    skip

          Test.skip();
          Test.skip(why);

      Skips the current test, reporting why.

    todoSkip

        Test.todoSkip();
        Test.todoSkip(why);

      Like skip(), only it will declare the test as failing and TODO.

    skipRest

        Test.skipRest();
        Test.skipRest(reason);

      Like skip(), only it skips all the rest of the tests you plan to run
      and terminates the test.

      If you're running under "noPlan", it skips once and terminates the
      test.

 Test style

    useNumbers

          Test.useNumbers(onOrOff);

      Whether or not the test should output numbers. That is, this if true:

        ok 1
        ok 2
        ok 3

      or this if false

        ok
        ok
        ok

      Most useful when you can't depend on the test output order.
      Test.Harness will accept either, but avoid mixing the two styles.
      Defaults to true.

    noHeader

          Test.noHeader(noHeader);

      If set to true, no "1..N" header will be printed.

    noEnding

          Test.noEnding(noEnding);

      Normally, Test.Builder does some extra diagnostics when the test
      ends. It also changes the exit code as described below. If this is
      true, none of that will be done.

 Output

    Controlling where the test output goes. It's ok for your test to change
    where document.write points to; Test.Builder's default output settings
    will not be affected.

    diag

          Test.diag(msg);
          Test.diag(msg, msg2, msg3);

      Prints out all of its arguments. All arguments are simply appended
      together for output.

      Normally, it uses the failureOutput() handle, but if this is for a
      TODO test, the todoOutput() handle is used.

      Output will be indented and marked with a "#" so as not to interfere
      with test output. A newline will be put on the end if there isn't one
      already.

      We encourage using this method rather than outputting diagnostics
      directly.

      Returns false. Why? Because diag() is often used in conjunction with
      a failing test (ok() || diag()) it "passes through" the failure.

          return ok(...) || diag(...);

 Output

    These methods specify where test output and diagnostics will be sent.
    By default, in a browser they all default to appending to the element
    with the "test" ID or, failing that, to using document.write. In
    Macromedia Director, they use trace for their output. If you wish to
    specify other functions that lack the apply() method, you'll need to
    supply them instead as custom anonymous functions that take a single
    argument (multiple arguments will be concatenated before being passed
    to the output function):

      Test.output(function (msg) { foo(msg) });

    output

          Test.output(function);

      Function to call with normal "ok/not ok" test output.

    failureOutput

          Test.failureOutput(function);

      Function to call with diagnostic output on test failures and diag.

    todoOutput

          Test.todoOutput(function);

      Function to call with diagnostic about todo test failures and diag.

    warnOutput

          Test.warnOutput(function);

      Function to call with warnings.

    endOutput

          Test.endOutput(function);

      Function to which to pass any end messages (such as "Looks like you
      planed 8 tests but ran 2 extra").

 Test Status and Info

    currentTest

          var currTest = Test.currentTest();
          Test.currentTest(num);

      Gets/sets the current test number we're on. You usually shouldn't
      have to set this property.

      If set forward, the details of the missing tests are filled in as
      "unknown". if set backward, the details of the intervening tests are
      deleted. You can erase history if you really want to.

    summary

          my @tests = Test.summary();

      A simple summary of the tests so far returned as an array or boolean
      values, true for pass, false for fail. This is a logical pass/fail,
      so todos are passes.

      Of course, test #1 is tests[0], etc...

    details

          my @tests = Test.details();

      Like summary(), but with a lot more detail.

        tests[testNum - 1] = {
            ok:        is the test considered a pass?
            actual_ok: did it literally say 'ok'?
            desc:      description of the test (if any)
            type:      type of test (if any, see below).
            reason:    reason for the above (if any)
        };

	* "ok" is true if Test.Harness will consider the test to be a pass.

	* "actual_ok" is a reflection of whether or not the test literally
	printed "ok" or "not ok". This is for examining the result of
	"todo" tests.

	* "description is the description of the test.

	* "type" indicates if it was a special test. Normal tests have a
	type of "". Type can be one of the following:

	skip see skip()

	todo see todo()

	todo_skip see todoSkip()

	unknown see below

      Sometimes the Test.Builder test counter is incremented without it
      printing any test output, for example, when currentTest() is changed.
      In these cases, Test.Builder doesn't know the result of the test, so
      it's type is "unknown". The details for these tests are filled in.
      They are considered ok, but the name and actual_ok is left null.

      For example "not ok 23 - hole count # TODO insufficient donuts" would
      result in this structure:

        tests[22] = {          // 23 - 1, since arrays start from 0.
            ok:        1,      // logically, the test passed since it's todo
            actual_ok: 0,      // in absolute terms, it failed
            desc:      'hole count',
            type:      'todo',
            reason:    'insufficient donuts'
        };

    todo

          TODO: {
              Test.todo(why, howMany);
              ...normal testing code goes here...
          }

      Declares a series of tests that you expect to fail and why. Perhaps
      it's because you haven't fixed a bug or haven't finished a new
      feature. The next howMany tests will be expected to fail and thus
      marked as "TODO" tests.

    caller

          var package = Test.caller();
          my(pack, file, line) = Test.caller();
          my(pack, file, line) = Test.caller(height);

      Like the normal caller(), except it reports according to your
      level().

    beginAsync

    endAsync

        var timeout = 3000;
        var asyncID = Test.beginAsync(timeout);
        window.setTimeout(
            function () {
                Test.ok(true, "Pass after 2 seconds");
                Test.endAsync(asyncID);
            }, timeout - 1000
        );

      Sometimes you may need to run tests in an asynchronous process. Such
      processes can be started using window.setTimeout() or
      window.setInterva() in a browser, or by making an XMLHttpRequest
      call. In such cases, the tests might normally run after the test
      script has completed, and thus the summary message at the end of the
      test script will be incorrect--and the test results will appear after
      the summary.

      To get around this problem, tell the Test.Builder object that you're
      running asyncronous tests by calling beginAsync(). The test script
      will not finish until you pass the ID returned by beginAsync() to
      endAsync(). If you've called beginAsync() with the optional timout
      argument, then the test will finish if endAsync() has not been called
      with the appropriate ID before the timeout has elapsed. The timeout
      can be specified in milliseconds.

    exporter

        if (typeof JSAN != 'undefined') new JSAN().use('Test.Builder');
        else {
            if (typeof Test == 'undefined' || typeof Test.Builder == 'undefined')
                throw new Error(
                    "You must load either JSAN or Test.Builder "
                    + "before loading Test.Simple"
                );
        }
      
        Test.Simple = {};
        Test.Simple.EXPORT      = ['plan', 'ok'];
        Test.Simple.EXPORT_TAGS = { ':all': Test.Simple.EXPORT };
        Test.Simple.VERSION     = '0.11';
      
        // .... Declare exportable functions, then export them.
      
        if (typeof JSAN == 'undefined') Test.Builder.exporter(Test.Simple);

      This method is used by Test.More and Test.Simple to export functions
      into the global namespace. It is only used if JSAN
      (http://www.openjsan.org/) is not available. Other test modules built
      with Test.Builder should also use this method to export functions. An
      optional second argument specifies the name space in which to export
      the functionls. Ifis not defined, it defaults to the window object in
      browsers and the _global object in Director.

Examples

    CPAN can provide the best examples. Test.Simple and Test.More both use
    Test.Builder.

      built with Test.Builder.

    http://www.edwardh.com/jsunit/

      JSUnit: elaborate xUnit-style testing framework. Completely unrelated
      to Test.Builder.

ToDo

      * Finish porting tests from Test::Simple.

      * Properly catch native exceptions, such as for syntax errors (is
      this even possible?).
