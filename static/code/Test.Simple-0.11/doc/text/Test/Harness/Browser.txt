Description

    STOP! If all you want to do is write a test script, consider using
    Test.Simple. Test.Harness is the module that reads the output from
    Test.Simple, Test.More and other modules based on Test.Builder. You
    don't need to know about Test.Harness to use those modules.

    Test.Harness.Browser runs JavaScript tests in a browser and expects to
    get the results from the TestResults attribute of the Test.Builder
    object constructed by each test script. These results conform to a
    format called TAP, the Test Anything Protocol. It is defined in
    http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Harness/lib/Test/Harness/TAP.pod. See
    Test.Harness for details on the output.

 Class Methods

      Test.Harness.Browser.runTests('testone.html', 'testtwo.html');

    Constructs a new Test.Harness.Browser object and calls its runTests()
    instance method, passing all arguments along.

 Constructors

      var harness = new Test.Harness.Browser();

    Constructs a new Test.Harness.Browser object.

 Instance Methods

    runTests

        harness.runTests('testone.html', 'testtwo.html');

      This method runs all the given test files and divines whether they
      passed or failed based on the contents of the TestRusults attribute
      of their global Test.Builder.Test object. It prints out each
      individual test that failed along with a summary report and a how
      long it all took. When all tests have been run, a diagnostic message
      will be output. See Test.Harness for details on the output.

 GET Options

    An HTML file that uses Test.Harness.Browser will automatically process
    the GET its arguments, and these can be used to affect the behavior of
    the harness.

    verbose

        index.html?verbose=1

      Set the verbose option to a true value to have all of the output of
      all of the tests in the harness output to the browser window. By
      default, only failing tests display their output.

    file

        index.html?file=foo.html,file=bar.html

      Set the file option to override the list of files passed to
      runTest(). This option may be specified multiple times, and each file
      specified will be passed to runTest().

Bugs

    Safari (and maybe KHTML?) has a number of bugs that affect how
    Test.Harness.Browser works. The most obvious is that it cannot run
    tests on a local disk. The harness only works in Safari if the tests
    are served by a Web server. The WebKit team is aware of the issue;
    expect it to be fixed in a future version.

    Other Safari bugs I repoted while writing this module:

    iFrame Doesn't seem to Respect a local "file://" src

      http://bugzilla.opendarwin.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3593

    Function.toString() Doesn't Stringify Constructors as Attributes

      Some tests are skipped in tests/create.html, tests/harness.html, and
      tests/more.html to work around this bug.

      http://bugzilla.opendarwin.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3537

    WebKit JavaScript Does not Properly Support Circular References

      One test is skipped in tests/circular_data.html to work around this
      bug.

      http://bugzilla.opendarwin.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3539

    iFrames Appear to be Cached

      http://bugzilla.opendarwin.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3580

    iFrames set to display:none are Missing from frames array

      So the iframe used to run tests isn't hidden in Safari. Instead, it
      is set to "height: 0; widht: 0".

      http://bugzilla.opendarwin.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3581

    Add Support for the watch() method of Object

      This would just be nice to have, so that we wouldn't have to set
      timeouts to check for test completion.
