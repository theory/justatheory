Name

    Test.Harness.Director - Run TAP standard JavaScript test scripts with
    statistics in Director

Synopsis

      Test.Harness.Director.runTests(
          'async_html',
          'bad_plan_html',
          'buffer_html',
          'builder_html'
      );

Description

    STOP! If all you want to do is write a test script, consider using
    Test.Simple. Test.Harness is the module that reads the output from
    Test.Simple, Test.More and other modules based on Test.Builder. You
    don't need to know about Test.Harness to use those modules.

    Test.Harness.Director runs JavaScript tests in Director and expects to
    get the results from the TestResults attribute of the Test.Builder
    object constructed by each test script. These results conform to a
    format called TAP, the Test Anything Protocol. It is defined in
    https://metacpan.org/dist/Test-Harness/lib/Test/Harness/TAP.pod. See
    Test.Harness for details on the output.

 Class Methods

      Test.Harness.Director.runTests('javascript_funtion_1', 'javascript_funtion_2');

    Constructs a new Test.Harness.Director object and calls its runTests()
    instance method, passing all arguments along.

 Constructors

      var harness = new Test.Harness.Director();

    Constructs a new Test.Harness.Director object.

 Instance Methods

    runTests

        harness.runTests('javascript_funtion_1', 'javascript_funtion_2');

      This method runs all the given test functions and divines whether
      they passed or failed based on the contents of the TestRusults
      attribute of their global Test.Builder.Test object. It prints out
      each individual test that failed along with a summary report and a
      how long it all took. When all tests have been run, a diagnostic
      message will be output. See Test.Harness for details on the output.

    To actually use this module, there is a a fair amount of Director
    scaffolding required. See http://www.gmccreight.com/TestSimple/ for
    additional downloads and documentation.
